comment,'Science has stopped': UNC community reacts to proposed NIH cuts,"One of the DOGE and Palantir concepts is that by scraping all the grant applications and reviews, a private sector super-AI machine can capture and own the entire production possibility frontier at much lower cost. There has not been any discussion or debate in Congress about whether scientific advancement depends not only on individual ideas, but also by carefully controlled criticism from others. These include people in related fields whose expertise is at or near the cutting edge, and careful discussion by elected representatives of the general public and by advocates of free speech. The result we are facing is: A gigantic cut in scientific research efforts on the grounds of purported efficiencies. This is carried out by someone who does not care about the downside risks of shattering a complex culture. Interlocking teams of sophisticated people seem to be hard to build and rebuild. What we are facing may be as disastrous as an invasion by Genghis Kahn. People who see only dollar signs simply don't care.",2025-02-28 08:06:41,29

comment,'Science has stopped': UNC community reacts to proposed NIH cuts,"Several reasons: 1. Job market. Prior to the shit show that’s happened, the US was a haven for good and well-paid science. Biotech, pharma, and even academia (if you compare it to the rest of the world) had room to grow and expand. 2. Getting out of the US is hard. I know, there are lots of internationals who figured out how to get into the US legally, so US citizens can figure out how to go elsewhere. But, by and large, US citizens don’t even know the steps to leave or where to start. Remember, most of us don’t know how to go through Visa processes because the US has privileged status (we’ll see how long that lasts). Furthermore, language barrier and lack of competitive edge on the world market. These are things that can be overcome, but remember, US had a large number of well paid scientific jobs. Now those are going away, but the scientists aren’t. Competition and supply will go up, so demand will drop… 3. The US is worth fighting for. I am not alone in my sentiments with this, I know. Change is possible, and we as scientists are used to failing a thousand times before succeeding once. Thousands of us have put the pipettes down and raised fists/flags, and thousands more will do so.",2025-03-03 07:32:37,3

comment,'Science has stopped': UNC community reacts to proposed NIH cuts,"Covid and the after math resulted in some critical people taking better private sector offers or retiring. The cancer center gets its money from a fund created by the state from tobacco sales, private contracts from many well known companies, and from federal grants. Those critical people knew how to record where the money was and how to catalogue it. So 4 years post COVID, the numbers didn’t add up and the Red got pretty bad and they laid off people and a lot of reorganization went underway. It’s left a lot of WORLD CLASS research professors kind of got screwed because the only people who could analyze their data were gone. They are also under new leadership due to the previous guy retiring. Changing times at the cancer center. I was one of those people laid off but I was working part time while in dental school so I have other things In My life to work on anyway. I worked in a fantastic team with fantastic people. Before the new federal administration the Cancer center was going through a temporary blip but now, it’s going to make things a LOT harder to get back in the financial black.

post,Calling out an alum,Calling out an alum I made a post about having little friends last semester and I recently got a chat request from a class of ‘86 alum named Mike who just wanted to chat. Class of 86 was already a red flag but looking at his post history (screenshot included) it’s just disgusting to think that there are people who want to prey on college students going through a tough time under the pretense of having a friendly chat with an alum.

comment,Calling out an alum,"pretty sure being into weird sex stuff and being a genuinely nice person aren’t mutually exclusive. You would probably be shocked at what some of your friends are into. Until the guy tried to hit on you or make a move you had no business speaking to him the way you did, nor posting it online. His message to you was nice and let you know you aren’t totally alone after you basically begged for some attention in your post. There’s nothing wrong with being careful and doing your research on someone who messages you but you definitely shouldn’t have posted it like you did, arguably you probably shouldn’t have posted it regardless.",2024-03-10 18:50:44,21

You made a post about feeling alone (publicly) and got responses and now you feel icky because you got a response to a post about wanting friends? *This is the internet*, if you post something publicly, especially if its a post about feeling lonely or isolated, the creeps will come. Maybe lets keep some stuff in the drafts. 2. Reddit is anonymous, we don’t know who you are and we don’t know who “Mike” is. This isn’t the call-out you think it is. 3. Why is his age a red flag? Without looking through his post history, he is just a man who happens to be older than you responding to YOUR post asking for help with loneliness. Is it so hard to fathom that someone older than you could want to connect and perhaps be an ear for you? 4. Like what are you so scared of? Its the internet, unless you choose to give him personal info, he can’t find you and do anything to you. If he gets creepy in chat, block.

comment,UNC Chancellor Says UNC Will Comply with ICE,"Just so everyone knows, no one here is against secure borders or enforcing immigration laws. Deportations didn’t start this week, they’ve always been part of the system. But in the past, they weren’t politicized, and people were treated with dignity and respect. What we’re against is the fear-based, politicized rhetoric driving mass deportations under the guise of “getting these people out of here.” Immigrants are unfairly labeled as criminals with absurd stereotypes like “they eat our dogs and cats.” Immigrants are the backbone of our food system, the ones picking the produce you eat, often exposed to dangerous chemicals like glyphosate and chlorpyrifos. They don’t take American jobs, they do the jobs Americans don’t want to do. They pay into Social Security, Medicare, and income taxes but never get a dime in return. They deserve dignity, respect, and the right to live without fear of being torn from their families while their kids are at school, all because some politician is following steps we’ve seen before in history. There’s a way to enforce immigration laws that treats people with dignity. For those who think they’re righteous, look at history. Read about Liberia. Read about the ships your ancestors came here on, often without permission. History has lessons, if we’re willing to listen.",2025-01-24 22:26:19,113

Even if you somehow managed to prevent any guns from entering the U.S like this, you would prevent mass shootings sure. But then people would just turn to other methods of destruction and mass shootings would just turn into mass killings. You have to solve the problem at the source.

Look at Massachusetts as an example. Highest population density in the country, multiple large, diverse cities- and still low gun deaths and violent crime rates because they have some of the strictest gun laws in the country. I don’t disagree that “we have to cut the problem at the source” and more gun control wouldn’t completely eliminate all gun-related problems, but the data shows it would help substantially.",2023-09-18 09:10:07,8

However, I don’t like when the right just closes their eyes and pretends like this is the price we have to pay to have guns. There are things we could fix. Universal Background checks and expanded healthcare seem like good places to start. But I honestly haven’t thought it out all the way. I also saw an idea the other day that we could only allow police stations or sheriffs offices or military bases to sell ammunition. Idk… I just really don’t like it when government throws their hands up and acts like we can’t do anything when our kids are being gunned down.

comment,Please stop saying today was a shooting.,"Okay riddle me this.... let's not ban guns because people will find the guns anyway and hurt people. Going off of that logic: let's not have nuclear weapon laws because people will find nuclear weapons and hurt people anyways? We clearly have NOT had nuclear war in a while BECAUSE of the stricter laws. Let me be clear, nobody is targeting the right to safety. It isn't about taking rights away. It's about increasing safety for everyone. If taking the guns out of the hands of these mentally unstable individuals can reduce the number of people who die everyday due to gun violence, then I'm for it, and so are the others arguing against gun laws. 100% let's work to fix mental health issues. 100% let's target the 8 other heads of the hydra, but your analogy is lacking in that it assumes the other 8 heads also kill people at the same rate as the head we're trying to cut off. In more simplistic but graphic terms, if someone threatened you with a weapon, would you be focusing on providing them with therapy in that moment while they have a weapon to your face or trying to get the weapon out of their hands and THEN get them to therapy? Now multiply that by the number of gun violence incidents in the country and you'll understand why it's imperative we get the guns out of people's hands first, then address the other concerns. Is stricter gun laws and gun control going to solve the problem completely? NO! But will it help reduce the number of innocent children dying on a classroom floor? ABSOLUTELY. Gun control invariably means less children dying, and I am for it. The point I think most people miss is questioning why there even is a need to have guns in civilians' hands? How are there other countries that are getting by without this? Why do they have less school shootings than us? Aren't we supposed to be the greatest country in the world with the mightiest military? Why do Americans then not feel safe? We're clearly doing something wrong. And if the current standard of gun control is continuing to place guns in the hands of individuals who shouldn't have them, and if you agree with me that these individuals shouldn't have had a gun in their hands and shouldn't have been able to take the lives of innocent people, then I think something needs to change.

You should ask your departments HR contact tomorrow, I guess. I've never had any comp leave, that I know of. Bonus leave, for the most part, is something that was awarded in lieu of annual raises back in the budget crisis days. Yeah ""Condition 2"" is kind of weird....are we closed, or not? But this is what they normally use when there is, say, a snowstorm. Condition 3 is pretty rarely invoked and the enormity of the tragedy yesterday rose to the threshold, it seems.",2023-08-29 13:33:11,3
comment,REMINDER: Classes are cancelled. Your professor cannot make you come to class or meet on zoom,"Wanting to talk about the issues surrounding a tragedy is not the same as victim blaming. I don't think anyone is arguing that what happened is anybody's fault other than the shooter who clearly committed an unjustifiable, evil act. The professor did not deserve to die, and I feel for him and anyone close to him. It is well known that PhD programs can be horrendous for mental health, and that faculty can contribute to that. We shouldn't make any assumptions about motive here until we know more, but it's ok to wonder if these factors contributed. Maybe the commenter above saying ""likely"" is too far, but it's certainly a possibility. The professor got arrested last year for strangling his wife. Is it really a stretch to think that maybe his lab environment was toxic? Even if that wasn't a factor in the shooter's motivation, it's an issue that needs improvement regardless. We need to address gun violence in this country. Doing that doesn't stop us from also addressing systems that lead to poor mental health. When mass school shootings happen, we address banning assault weapons, and making schools more secure (as we should). But we also address mental health support, and bullying prevention programs, while still placing the full responsibility on the shooters. Addressing the totality of situations does not equal victim blaming.",2023-09-01 21:13:28,2
comment,REMINDER: Classes are cancelled. Your professor cannot make you come to class or meet on zoom,"We can recognize that there is a toxic culture amongst university faculty in this country (and worldwide) without excusing murder. That is in no way saying the murderer was justified. If someone had their wallet stolen, and shot the pickpocket in the back as they were running, I think most of us would agree that the shooting was murder and wrong. If someone acknowledged that the theft was still wrong, that's not saying ""this killing was justified"". There is a huge mental health issue amongst college students, especially grad students, due to the way they are treated by professors. The answer is not violence, but it doesn't mean we can't discuss that issue just because one person was horrible and violent.",2023-09-01 14:00:54,0

post,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down? I was in an anthropology lecture yesterday and I’m not sure if I’m being dramatic but it was probably one of the worst lockdown situations I’ve been in. Besides the fact that at first my prof kept teaching, what got me was that after locking the doors they kept letting people out to go to the bathroom… and let someone’s partner in (who wasn’t already in the class) to check on her. I KNOW it was a long time and people had to pee. I had to pee. But for the 2 hours we had no clue where he was or what he looked like, the fact that people were going back and forth like it was nothing was just bizarre to me, and really pissing me off. We’re talking 5, 6, 7 groups of people leaving and returning. Door CONSTANTLY opening and closing. It’s not like we were next to Caudill in Peabody, but it’s in a range where we should not have felt so nonchalant about it.

They all know what to do, and what not to do. University faculty aged 40 and up often have ZERO experience or training with lockdowns. We literally don't know the protocols. Lockdown drills *did not exist"" when we were in high school. And in spite of the fact that my university campus had a mass shooting in 2014 in which six students died (four of whom I knew personally), and dozens were injured, our campus *still* has not instituted any lockdown training for faculty. I'm not saying that's ok. It's clearly not. Nor am I justifying or defending anyone's actions. I'm just adding some context.",2023-08-29 12:20:40,57
comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"New faculty member here: nope, no training for us. I’m international too so never went through the school system here where you learn these things. I went out of my way a couple years ago in grad school to learn about what to do because I am responsible for my students, but not many others do this. I’ve already talked to my higher ups this morning about suggesting improvements to the protocol that’s in place. Please reach out to someone and report this (e.g., the chair of the department, the Dean, the helpline). Y’all are in my thoughts.",2023-08-29 09:56:58,57
comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"To be honest this sounds like a failure at the institutional level to adequately train and prepare faculty for lockdown/active shooter situations than it does any particular professor fucking up, although I've already heard a few similar anecdotes of professors clearly not taking it seriously enough or being tone deaf about it (e.g. that instructor who tried to get people to join zoom class that's been making the rounds on twitter). At the end of the day the university itself is responsible for answering for the shortcomings in communication and response yesterday more than any specific faculty member. Frankly it's mindblowing to me that UNC doesn't already have mandatory faculty training for this.",2023-08-29 15:06:20,46
comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"I was shocked at the response of professors in class rooms. Are they not trained in lock down procedure? My daughters class once got the alert notified the professor and asked her should they get on the floor, turn off the lights and block the door? The professor said ""if yall want to"". WHAT??? So the class did that and then a few minutes later after the students were putting all the desks against the door the professor said that door doesn't lock but my office does and she moved them all into her office. But it took a long time for her to react to what was going on. I heard a similar story in another classroom and Lenoir. Are UNC staff not trained what to do in a lockdown?

comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"This is an institutional failure to explain what any of the alerts meant.

This includes allowing people to go to the bathroom. But clearly other people thought it meant there could be an active shooter in their building.

comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"Faculty at UNC are not explicitly trained. There is a [website with guides and videos](https://campussafety.unc.edu/carolina-ready/resources/) that I encourage you to visit if you want to feel more prepared. Several years ago, there was a campus-wide initiative to make sure [all classroom doors lock](https://campussafety.unc.edu/carolina-ready/resources/classroom-door-locks/). I think former Dean Hogan led that charge. If yours don’t lock (as noted by other commenters), please report it to someone, as that is a huge safety concern. Finally, I’ll add that I’ve gone through active shooter training in other capacities, and I find it anxiety-inducing and just terrible all around. [A study of K-12 schools found that lockdown drills cause psychological harm](https://everytownresearch.org/report/the-impact-of-active-shooter-drills-in-schools/), and there’s not get evidence that they provide much benefit, especially given how statistically rare mass shootings are. Of course, even the relatively rare shootings our country has are more than the 0 shootings other economically comparable nations face, and that is a travesty too. I hope y’all are hanging in there and leaning on each other for support. Please talk to someone if you’re having a hard time. There are loads of us who want to help.",2023-08-29 09:31:23,27

comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"In the nursing department, they stopped all class activities and locked all the doors, kept us away from the windows.

comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"I was in the big auditorium on the first floor of Hamilton. That room has 4 entrances: 2 black double doors people can enter from inside the building, 2 doors at the front of the room that people outside can directly enter in. Throughout the entire lockdown, NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THE DOORS WERE LOCKED. The 2 black double doors had a lock that barely worked, so a bunch of students ended up having to barricade them with chairs. As for the 2 doors that lead directly outside, the professor had no idea how to lock them. So the entire time, if the shooter wanted to, he could have EASILY entered into our classroom from the front doors.",2023-08-29 09:53:57,19

comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"To sum it up, yes. My son said their door did not even lock and kids were literally getting up and leaving as the professor begged them to stay as soon as the alert got. She positioned herself in front of the door in an attempt to shield her students, but let’s be honest… It would’ve been useless. In addition, the lights were left on the entire time and half of the students didn’t even move to the sides or back of the room. This is bothersome because locked doors, no lights, and moving out of sight are proven time barriers in such instances. Something I learned as a school principal with stats to back it up. Even with the blinds closed, movement would’ve easily been seen bc the lights were left on. I have a lot of questions as a mother, if I’m being honest. I’m angry for you guys and I feel you have a right to be angry as well. I think this is something we need to come together and discuss as a community, because this situation could have been far, far worse than it was. Sending healing vibes to you and I hope that we can come together and bring about some change for you guys. You deserve better. ❤️‍🩹",2023-08-29 22:06:52,23
comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"The training situation is a little more complicated - my department (biology) just had active shooter training two weeks ago. It wasn't mandatory, but it's also training that the campus police offer, and that can be requested. The guy teaching it was apparently teaching it more than once a day as of two weeks ago - hopefully more folks can join him teaching because demand is going to be high. I'm pretty sure in our case it was arranged through our department chair, so if this sounds like a good plan talk to your chair about setting one up. I know the last time I taught I talked about lockdown procedures on the first day - in a somewhat lighthearted way, because I didn't want people freaked out, but I also wanted to plant the seeds in their heads. I'm not sure if we were encouraged to do this at a department level of a university level or what - it's probably in email somewhere. During our training a couple of weeks back, I finally got to ask my question about breaking windows - because I was teaching in one of those first floor classrooms in genome sciences, and they're the obvious alternative exit.

comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"The bigger concern I have is that the best practice is to run, if you can, not hide. If this had actually been an active shooter, you put yourself at higher risk by backing yourself into a corner. Further, there was no communication of critical details to inform and empower the community to protect itself. While many were able to find this information out in a number of ways, it should have been communicated via Alert Carolina. Why was the lockdown not more localized? Why did the lockdown continue for what, 2 hours after the suspect was in custody? Why was the lockdown continued for hours after the last shot was reported? My point is not to kick everyone who did the best they could under the circumstances, but to consider how we can do better and save lives, god forbid it is ever necessary.",2023-08-30 14:53:22,7

comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"It's scattershot. I'm fifty.\* My first experience with a lockdown was pre-Columbine, when I was at Microsoft. (Someone came onto the campus with a gun, demanding we send out his former girlfriend. Uh, no.) This was my third on a university campus. The active shooter training via the biology department was not my first active shooter training, though it was my first since I've gotten here. \[Edit: fixed spelling. Yikes!\] (On a entirely personal note, there's also twenty-seven years of studying martial arts, and seventeen years of teaching them. Mostly open hand and traditional weapons, but I've also taken a fair bit of emergency response and how to deal with a gunman type stuff. Which, let me add, doesn't mean I'm an action hero or anything. Sadly! But it does shape how I think about these things.) I don't know what is the best level of training. It sounds like a lot of faculty, at least, would have benefited from the active shooter training which is available but not mandatory. And I'm going to continue to bring up how to handle emergencies with students on the first day of class - next semester, in my case, since I'm not teaching this one. \* Yes, and a postdoc - I was a software engineer before I went first into computational biochem, then did a doctorate in neuromechanics, and now do biorobotics.",2023-08-29 13:15:27,11

My partner is a faculty member who is over 40 and not from the US (I.e., from a country with heavy gun regulations). They have had NO mandatory training through UNC or any other university they have worked at. I’ve been a bit frustrated to see that some folks expect the faculty to follow the mysterious protocol when they haven’t been informed or educated on what it entails. I do agree, however, that they should follow clear directives from the university in these situations and maintain some semblance of order in their classrooms when something like this happens (I.e., stop teaching, try to secure the entrances, etc.).

comment,Was anyone else’s class REALLY bad at locking down?,"This is so true! Lockdown training is option for faculty and not available to grad students (who do a lot of teaching at UNC). As a grad student in philosophy, I did have to take a workplace safety course where I learned how to handle toxic chemicals, safely lift heavy things, and about OSHA. I think UNC takes a very coarse-grained approach to things like this. I’m not sure why, but I’m sure it involved a consultant or lawyer getting paid a lot of money to make the decision. Which is very strange because most of the teaching population are old enough that they did not get any lockdown training in college or high school.

post,Falsely Imprisoned at UNC Orientation,"Falsely Imprisoned at UNC Orientation **I did NOT talk to the daily tarheel, not sure if anyone involved did or they wrote that article on their own. I received a formal apology from UNC. Not going to delete my post, but I’ve moved on and I am done thinking/talking about the situation.** I attended the first session of UNC orientation on Wednesday 6/11 and Thursday 6/12. I think the events that occurred to my group were genuinely illegal and I’m looking for advice on where to go from here. After the heel world skit show, we were supposed to go to the late night party thing. When the OLs were bowing after the show, my group noticed our OL was not on stage with everyone else. They then made an announcement that everyone else could proceed to the late night party but everyone in group 9 needed to stay in the auditorium. We asked why we were being kept, they would not tell us. Asked if our OL was okay, they said they couldn’t tell us. They used vague terms like we don’t know the severity of the situation and made it seem very serious. There were 17 of us in my group and they would not answer a single question we asked them and were very rude to us. Eventually, we overhead one of the women watching us talking on a phone call. She said that they needed police and there was a sexual harassment case. That’s when we realized what was happening. During the skit show, one of the guys in my group took a picture of our OL on stage and edited a unicorn horn on her head. He sent it along with a unicorn emoji in our group me with the entire group, including the OL. I don’t know if I should post it here but I can assure you that the picture was completely innocent and just a stupid joke. It was not meant to offend anyone and was definitely not sexual harassment. (While the NSFP staff watching us would still not answer questions, it was confirmed later that all of this drama was over the picture he sent). After about 30-45 minutes of being in the room, two men came in and said we were free to leave. Lady in the back says no, we can’t leave until the police get there. We were treated like criminals. The first time a girl asked to use the bathroom, they initially said no but eventually gave in. Everyone had to be escorted to and from the bathroom. The police came and were outside the door talking to the staff about the “situation” but still no one was telling us what was going on. We asked to talk to the police, they told us no there’s only one and they’re already talking to staff. (There were multiple police officers they just lied to us). Someone asked “Are we being detained by the police?” and they just said “you can’t leave.” They later told a girl that we would be seen as “not cooperating” if we left and that the police were collecting our names and that’s why it was taking so long (that doesn’t make any sense considering there were 17 of us in the room, with name tags, and they never came in the room and asked for any of our names) Eventually some guy in my group wore them down, not sure what he said but once he was done talking they let the police in the room. The police said they just got there (lie) and that they weren’t sure of the details of the situation. At this point we had been in the room well over an hour. That officer left without saying much. About ten minutes later, he came back with another officer. They told us that were NOT being detained by the police and they didn’t know that we were being held for so long by the staff. They said we were free to go and none of us were in trouble. At that point we left and walked back to Hinton James to go to sleep. It was around 10pm when I got back. They cancelled the entirety of the last small group for ALL GROUPS because of this. The only people who apologized to us were the two police officers, not the NSFP staff who were the ones holding us there for over TWO HOURS. We missed the whole late night event and the pizza and cookies we were promised. All because of a stupid yet innocent picture that ONE person sent in the group me. I’m very upset with all this obviously. The orientation was supposed to be a fun event to welcome us to UNC, and instead I was kept hostage in a room for two hours and led to believe that I was being detained by police. If you’re wondering “why didn’t you just leave?” We were afraid of getting in trouble. We didn’t want our acceptance to be rescinded or worse, to get into legal trouble. This has left a sour taste and my mouth and I was excited to go to UNC and now I’m just incredibly frustrated. These are the people who are supposed to be supporting us. The way they treated us was completely unacceptable and unfair and I want to know where I should go from here. I think at the very least my orientation fee should be refunded. I’m posting here not only looking for advice on where to go from here but also because I think more people should know about the way we were treated by UNC. EDIT: I want to clear some things up because misinformation is being spread rampantly. People seem to think something else happened and that the police wouldn’t just show up over the picture. I assure you I’m not leaving details out and if you look in the comments other people present have vouched for me. If the picture was truly inappropriate, they wouldn’t have let us out and told us we weren’t in trouble. I have since gotten more information that the boy who took the picture voluntarily stayed to talk to the police and that his parents came. Apparently, the staff did apologize to him and said they were getting better training for their employees to avoid something like this happening again. I don’t know how this rumor that they were taking pictures up her skirt happened, but I can assure you it has no merit whatsoever. If someone who is spreading this rumor would like to actually talk to me and tell me where they got this information I would be more than willing to talk, but instead they want degrade and bully me on yikyak. Funny how these people who “support women” are being so terrible to a woman who’s sharing her experience of being wronged. Don’t know why we’re blindly believing some random person over my detailed first hand account that has been backed up by other commenters. I have no reason to lie about all of this. The police did genuinely show up over the unicorn picture. That’s why I’m so upset. If this was a case of sexual harassment, I would not be this upset about it. I’m a woman and a devout feminist, I would never downplay a genuine sexual harassment case. But this is not what the situation was. What also upsets me is that there are genuine sexual assault issues at UNC and those are dismissed, meanwhile a group of completely innocent students are detained over a unicorn picture. Just received new information that the OL did not report it, it was people in the audience who saw the guy taking photos and reported it. She was upset we were being kept and asked for everyone not involved to be released. We all liked her and we were nice to her, the same boys you seem to think were acting maliciously were loudly cheering for her throughout the entire skit show. She also messaged in the groupme “hey guys, i won’t be at late night or small group breakout 3 tonight. i hope you all have a great night!” while we were being held in the room. She definitely wouldn’t have sent that if she felt unsafe and boys in the group were taking pictures up her skirt like some people are saying. I have no animosity towards her at all and none of this was her fault. I assure you all the OL was absolutely fine. Also, I didn’t take the picture. Not sure why some commenters seem to think that’s the case. I said it was stupid. No, I don’t think he should’ve taken or sent the picture. I would understand if they pulled aside the one boy and talked to him. But they did not need to hold all of us in a room for two hours because of it. People calling me dramatic, sure, whatever. Maybe I used the term “false imprisonment” a little loosely, but they did keep us in a room under false pretense that we were being detained by the police. I don’t care that much about the pizza and cookies and party like some of you seem to think. I’m mad about the principle of the situation and the way that the staff handled it. I’m not going to forget about it and let them sweep it under the rug. All I really want is a formal apology and refund. I am fully aware the case likely has no legal merit and I never intended to actually take any sort of legal action. I’ve filed a formal complaint with UNC and I may talk to the daily tarheel about it. I am not immature, I am not stupid, and some strangers on the internet aren’t going to convince me I am. I never thought my post would get this much reach. I’m willing to answer any questions anyone has, but please do not spread rumors or claim I’m lying without actually talking to me first.

comment,Falsely Imprisoned at UNC Orientation,"Hi everyone. I was in group 9 and experienced this event first hand. The original poster of this thread described the events of the night perfectly, so I have decided to give my take on the event as well as answer some questions people seem to have about it. Although everyone acted pretty calm and collected and cool about the situation at first, we all started to get genuinely worried and concerned after about the 45 minute mark and when we heard that police were being involved. As the original poster said, I started getting worried that they could take back our admission to Carolina or worse—even for those who were not involved with taking the photo. The staff genuinely made it seem like we had committed a crime and were going to go to jail. We heard rumors that the reason for our detainment was about harassment and were shocked. As someone who has experienced SA and is a very passionate advocate for victims of it, the picture sent in the group chat was by no means a form of sexual harassment. During the 1-2 hours that I was in there, I prepared myself to speak with police and stand up for my group mates about how the picture was in no way sexual harassment. There were no bad intentions behind anything said or done during the skit. Did someone maybe take something too far, sure. But did that warrant being unlawfully detained, scared, and treated like criminals, absolutely not. For those asking about why we did not contact our parents, we did. I texted my mom at the 45 minute mark explaining the situation, and she was very shocked and confused. My dad was even prepared to come and pick me up because we live 40 mins away from campus. I told my mom that if we were still being kept in the room at 10pm, I would take him up on his offer. We were released before 10, so that is why I was not picked up. For me, the most damaging thing was not the situation itself, but rather the way that UNC staff chose to handle it (or lack thereof). After the police told us that we were free to go, we got no apology or comment from the staff who held us there. This whole situation was extremely disappointing to me because my first experience at UNC was literally traumatic. Anyways, I’m happy to answer any more questions people have. Definitely a complicated situation that I’m sure UNC isn’t super eager about having to explain and address. Edit/Update: I’ve seen what people are saying on YikYak and yes, the story is as ridiculous/unbelievable as it sounds. That’s why we are speaking out about it. People are saying that the cops wouldn’t be called over just the picture—that’s the point. They were called for no reason. Nothing more happened than the one picture. Literally there’s a reason why the cops said we were free to go and had done nothing wrong.",2025-06-13 21:33:45,62

comment,Falsely Imprisoned at UNC Orientation,"Ok, I get why you're upset, that must have been really scary. I think people don't realize how long 2 hours can be when you're scared and confused. And the heightened emotions when a major, exciting life event like MOVING OUT OF YOUR PARENTS HOME TO START COLLEGE is derailed and turns ugly. The situation was handled very badly, but it sounds like genuine human error made by people--probably volunteers--who had no idea what to do. I'm sorry that happened to you. I don't think you have any real recourse. Sometimes shitty things happen for no good reason, and there's nobody who can/should be punished. They can't give you back your orientation experience. You'll find that a lot of stupid shit happens in adult life that is scary, frustrating, and unfair, especially when very large institutions are involved.

comment,Falsely Imprisoned at UNC Orientation,"If you ask the police if you are being detained and they say you can't leave, then you are being detained. If it lasts longer than is needed to conduct the investigation that's related to your detainment or there is no reason for initially detaining you then they are breaking laws. It's a good idea to learn basic information like this to protect yourself. I believe, legally, staff had no right to detain you or your group. One thing that sucks about college is you will be legally responsible as an adult, treated as a child, and taken advantage of due to your inexperience and naivete.

comment,Photos from the protest on Franklin today.,"Funny because under Obama, deportations focused on recent border crossers and people with criminal records and the process involved actual courts and paper. He did it the right way, not sending the national guards to terrorize communities and instilling fear into our nation, not detaining hardworking immigrants.

comment,Can relate,"I have a few classes with no class schedules on the syllabus. These are all asynchronous classes.

comment,I Got Locked Out Of My Twitter And The Video Got Deleted So I'm Posting It Here. Last Night 11:00 PM,"This video was brought up for like a total of two minutes in the emergency UNC faculty executive committee meeting. Robert Blouin was the one who responded to the concern with basically saying that the university could do nothing and it was up to the police and the health department. In all honestly, I'm tired of this ""hands are tied"" explanation. Enough is enough. This is a university affiliated organization. It is one that is made up of solely UNC Chapel Hill students. These events are solely occuring because UNC has decided to bring its students back on campus. They do not get to claim no responsibility. Sanctions on the sororities, canceling rush, etc. the list could go on. At this point, they just do not care. Its time to take action. Kevin Guskiewicz mentioned that 28 out of the 30 panhellenic and fraternities have submitted their opening plans to OCHD. The other two have until the end of the week or face consequences. My question, why hasn't this plan been ready? There are students on campus. The deadline shouldn't have been this week, but at the very LEAST last week. Also the original tweet had a response in which somebody said the police did show up, but said they could not do anything because they weren't doing anything wrong. They said a noise complaint would be grounds for doing something. But apparently large gatherings in the middle of a pandemic is okay.",2020-08-05 17:57:23,115

comment,Photos from Campus Today,"Just out of curiosity: where does the concept come from that UNC is investing in any sort of IDF or war-forwarding programs ? I have personally yet to see any substantiation of that other than a bunch of people sort of assuming that they do. Protesting is a foundational right, but I am unsure how any of this is grounded in anything other than a suspicion that UNC is tangentially related to some sort of Israeli something or other that may or may not be loosely related to the efforts in Gaza. If there is concrete substantiation for UNC being involved in something like that, I’d appreciate someone linking it. For now, I do frankly feel that some of this is performative in nature and sort of on-brand for the self-congratulating portion of young leftist politics that seeks to be a martyr rather than an activist. Again, no issue with protests, but maybe a poor allocation of resources and unclear targeting of UNC as an institution.",2024-04-29 14:54:20,28
comment,Photos from Campus Today,"I feel like every student/alum I know has very strong opinions on this matter. It's either: you are supporting genocide or you are supporting terrorism. The Gaza Strip covers a small area of 365 km2. To put into perspective, Raleigh covers an area of 388 km2. More than half the population in Gaza are refugees. It has one of the highest unemployment rates. The blockade in 2007 has not made things better for Palestinians. Resurgence of resistance is expected from the drastically stressed community, which used to span from span from Eilat to Metula just 70 years ago and has been subject to several conflicts. Israel is a key figure for the United States in the Middle East, essentially controlling Iranian movement. Iranian Parliament members came together and chanted 'Death to America' just three years ago - this is nothing new and is reciprocated by much of the Middle East, which holds the US responsible for its slow development or regression. Israel mitigates threats, advances US interests, and is backed by Jewish American lobbying. They are seen as essential in keeping things clean and ""free from evil"" while doing the evil that Americans do not want to be caught doing. Personally, I don't know how eradicating what's left in Gaza is helping Americans except for the real estate aspect, which has been pushed quickly. This seems to be more of an Israeli interest. It is no secret that they view their neighbors as inferior - being subjected to attacks on civilians does seem like the final straw, which they now reciprocate. But Israel is America's police dog, and when that dog bites someone, you are inclined to look the other way. In summary, clearly both Netanyahu and Hamas are in the wrong by violating human rights causing many thousands of people to lose their lives for nothing. But like many Americans, I also value democracy and need a fancy job to pay for my fancy car and that might just require two non-American countries going at it than having the US lose its position in the long run, so I don't really know where to go from here. I guess I just have to go home and to work, do the things I can control, vote for my local government, work on my own nonprofit and see what little aspect of change I can cause to improve the world.",2024-04-29 00:02:28,22

comment,Photos from Campus Today,"Like any liberal college, UNC is ripe for these types of protests.

comment,Photos from Campus Today,"Makes you think. “Man, they really made a big mistake doing that terrorist attack on innocent Israelis enjoying a music festival. Killing children and raping women and taking hostages.” I guess the plus side for them is that students at extremely liberal universities in the United States would months later take down the flag of their own country and raise the flag of a country who committed a racially motivated terror attack. Not surprising though.",2024-05-01 01:19:26,8

comment,Photos from Campus Today,I mean it definitely isn't as black and white as just wasting our money. I don't like how much we're sending them though. It started as the US supporting the Jewish state but I think what it is now is more. It seems like the US uses Israel as a forward military testing system. They funds we give them are strings attached. They share research and war data with us. It's like being in a war without having to send your own citizens and still getting good research out of it. It also makes israel an independent military power dependent on US aid. I'm not saying I agree with it. I'm in the military so I'd rather see it a different way. I would like them to focus on developing the US. But it isn't as black and white as self sabotage. They have reasons. Good or bad.,2024-04-29 09:43:13,2

Students, professors, faculty, staff, the lovely ladies that call us baby in the dining hall. It was the [BOG](https://www.northcarolina.edu/leadership-and-governance/) who did this. The same goddamn BOG who tried to build a TWO MILLION DOLLAR shrine to Silent Sam. Let’s please keep these incompetent assholes separate from the phenomenal community that makes up UNC.

comment,UNC didn’t do this. Let’s get specific.,"Semantics aside, you can’t simply vote out the board of governors. Let’s not accidentally mislead people into believing these goons were officials elected by the people. Those who sit on the BoG were handpicked by the N.C. State Legislature, which is who we vote for and who holds the power in deciding what the entire UNC system looks like. They politicize our safety, because they are politicians and are appointed by politicians. I think that going too specific on the BoG also runs the risk of excusing administration, staff, faculty, students... anyone part of this community from taking a stand when they damn well should. “Well, someone else is to blame.” No, we are all to blame. The BoG is a symptom. We absolutely need to vote, flip the general assembly, and see more diverse, representative appointments made.

comment,UNC didn’t do this. Let’s get specific.,"Quick correction: The shrine to Silent Sam was actually over FIVE million dollars, and it was a plan created by UNC Chapel Hill's administration (Carol Folt) in coordination with UNC Chapel Hill's Board of Trustees. The BoG actually voted against the plan, feigning concern over the cost of the shrine, when in reality they bowed to the public onslaught against the plan. IIRC correctly it was the BoG that tasked UNC-CH with making a plan for the statue. The gift to neo-confederate racists was the one that was two million, and was indeed led by the BoG.",2020-08-18 15:14:26,41

comment,UNC didn’t do this. Let’s get specific.,"Alright, let me address a couple things. Assuming specifics like an expectation to resign for professors with families to feed or withdrawal from students is a straw man argument. My comment that there are those (SOME, not all) in every segment of the population who need to take a stand in some way and don't is an appeal to a broader truth: we all have spheres of influence and conversations to have in order to affect change. I said should, not should have. This in no way specifies or boils down to, ""Professors who stayed and taught, students who didn't withdraw, didn't take a stand, *and they should have*."" ""Take a stand"" - not everybody can take a stand in North Carolina specifically by voting. So how does one do their part in the community they call home? There's a whole UC/CSU system that while you don't attend, your vote may impact. There are politics and major decisions there for which you can personally take a stand. That you are here speaking about the BoG and saying that needs change is doing exactly what I was talking about. We are all responsible for doing our part, and you're doing it. I don't hold every individual accountable, but I hold *any* individual accountable who had the real power and responsibility to choose better in the days, months and years leading up to this situation and didn't. It's not an attack, but a simple fact of the matter, that everyone has something they can do to better someone else's situation. Those students who didn't wear a mask when they could have. Those faculty who wrote a letter pleading with students to stay home and didn't address higher ups who forced a lot of students into on-campus classes in the first place. Those that are higher up and didn't budge. They certainly hold some blame. When I say we are all to blame, I am not saying that literally each and every person is to blame for these past couple weeks. I'm saying that there's no exempt group that escapes examination in a community, and we all have responsibility to help steer the UNC ship onto a better course.",2020-08-18 16:12:51,12

comment,UNC didn’t do this. Let’s get specific.,"Chancellor Carol Folt, Provost Bob Blouin (still here, and the same guy that yesterday said he wouldn't apologize for trying to reopen UNC), and the Board of Trustees. Folt and Blouin came up with the plan, and the BoT approved. Two members of the BoT voted against the plan, the student representative (Savanna Putman or something like that? I know that's wrong but along those lines) and another member who I believe voted against the plan cause he wanted the statue back in McCorkle. Everyone else voted in favor. The plan also included plans to build a 2 million dollar per year mobile police force to further ""control"" protest movements on campus. https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2018/12/unc-chapel-hill-chancellor-folt-and-board-of-trustees-decide-to-move-silent-sam-to-new-freestanding-building-to-make-center-for-history-on-campus",2020-08-18 15:20:37,19
comment,UNC didn’t do this. Let’s get specific.,"The BOG is clearly not giving Chancellors and BOTs autonomy to make decisions, but the UNC-CH Chancellor also knew what he was getting into. He was here when Folt was forced out. There's a well-established pattern of the BOG pushing campus administrators to carry out harmful decisions. He had the option of resigning in protest -- or taking action on his own like Folt knowing that he'd be forced to resign. It's true that they might have found someone who accepted their party line as much as our dear Provost ""We Had No Way of Knowing"" Blouin, but the turnover would definitely make news. It would have a greater possibility for forcing the BOG to take a safer approach than our petitions had.

comment,UNC didn’t do this. Let’s get specific.,"I understand people wanting to give credit to Folt for her departing move, but she doesn't deserve it. Her administration spent their entire tenure ignoring the students and community members who wanted the statue gone, not to mention deploying a fully militarized police force to defend the statue. Plenty of people will argue that she has to act according to the rules set in place, but it's about time people realize that those rules only exist to maintain the positions of the powerful. Folt left and immediately went to a kush new job at a new university. University administration has been corporatized to the point where administrators have no connection to the state, its people, or the student body as a whole and really only act as controlled opposition. The same thing has happened with this scandal. Low-level staff and students have assumed all the risk and taken all the blame. Activists were asking white tenured faculty to strike in support and they didn't. Layers and layers of bureaucrats pushed out public messaging trying to convince people that this was a good idea despite all evidence to the contrary. Any number of them along the way could have stood up but didn't, and that's the real shame. The BOG is a smoke screen--you're not going to vote out business interests in a heavily gerrymandered state, and--let's be real--the Democrats had control of this state for decades before the GOP took the reins. The way the University is acting now is the the outcome of a long chain of events, and letting the admin off the hook is more than they deserve. What we need is a full reevaluation of the state university system and a shift away from the academy as a revenue machine.",2020-08-20 17:12:59,1

Many in MLK Jr.'s (the author of the quote) family were vegan activists and LGBT activists, believing it was an extension of his philosophy. Edit: also, many holocaust survivors say how strikingly similar our treatment of animals is to human genocide, call humans n@zis for it, or say that it is a Holocaust. Including the founder of the first US farm animal rights organization, Alex Hershaft, who lost his father to the camps and most of his family to n@zis.

post,Affair with Professor - question,"Affair with Professor - question EDIT: Since this has been getting a lot of attention - while there were parts of the relationship that were consensual, there were other parts that were not. I wrote “not so great stuff” because I really did not want to get into the details here for my own privacy - I just wanted to find a community. Apologies for anyone who thinks I am looking for revenge. Alright everyone... this is the first time I've ever posted about this. I (F24) had an affair with one of my professors (M, about 55) from UNC back in between 2017 and 2020 (I want to keep it sort of vague for a reason). This professor, who was in his 50s, did some not so great stuff with me, when I was still a teenager. I found out later that there were more of us women out there, and I would love to find these women. The professor has since left UNC, but my question for you is - if you were a student or professor/ have siblings that might know of any rumors of anyone that had an affair with a professor in the Poli Sci department around the time frame above, would you be able to either reply to this post or message me with your story?

comment,Affair with Professor - question,"In biology where I am, there is a whole anonymous reporting system. (As well as, of course, a non anonymous one.) I don't know if poli-sci has something similar. And, of course, you need to be deliberate in who you talk to, as many are mandatory reporters.\* It seems likely that you already know this, but just in case. There is a lot of variation in how many resources title nine offices have, and, frankly, how much their focus is on addressing problems vs. trying to make them go away to preserve the university's reputation. I don't know much about UNC enforcement (though I've been pretty impressed by my colleagues in biology - it just hasn't come up.) (But I live mostly in my own little research bubble, other than teaching a few classes.) I think what you're doing makes a lot of sense. When a protege of mine\*\* was harassed by her PI (in a totally different state), it came out that there had been twenty years of complaints against the guy, but no one was willing to go on record because they figured it would tank their future careers. You are almost certainly in company. Ping me if there's anything I can do to help. \* I don't know the whole system here, but I got to know if fairly well at my past institution - a former research student was sexually assaulted and then stalked on campus, and I was helping her navigate it. During which process I found out that all graduate students were mandatory reporters, and none of us knew that! \*\* A martial arts student of mine before she went into biology - but I was also friends with her mother, and new the student since she was seven. I was in industry for some time before I returned to academia, so I'm a grey haired postdoc now.

There were alot of effort to keep it all quiet,but people came forward to testify and a Title iX investigation was started. Scott Matthews finally had to leave CMU since the students finally had enough of being abused and took a stand. But it required doing what you are doing now, reaching out and trying to find other victims. It was hard work. We continued raising the issues even after Scott Matthews was gone because it wasn’t just about him. It was about the lack of oversight, failure to enforce protections and a group of professors who knew each for years and tried to cover up.

comment,UNC-Chapel Hill grad student Tailei Qi charged with murder in shooting death of professor,"PhD student here from Georgia Tech. Came on this sub to find out a bit more about what happened. Unfortunately in STEM PhD programs, I find that more labs are toxic than not. It's actually somewhat rare to find a lab where everyone is healthy and well adjusted. It's not always the PI's fault, either. Academia is just full of stressors, most of the people in PhD programs are extremely type A personalities who are hyper competitive and feel the need to outdo each other at all costs, so things can get ugly. Have even heard of labs that are so toxic people sabotage each others experiments. PIs are under a ton of pressure to publish and teach too, particularly early on in their career, and even if they are a nice person and good scientist sometimes the overwhelming stress of publish or perish gets passed on to the culture of the lab. I wish I was surprised that this happened but mostly I am surprised it doesn't happen more often. Grad school is a pressure cooker full of overworked people with poor coping skills and no time for a life outside of work. It's the hardest, most depressing and soul crushing thing I've ever put myself through.",2023-08-29 15:29:14,64

comment,UNC-Chapel Hill grad student Tailei Qi charged with murder in shooting death of professor,"I finished my PhD decades ago, but the program I was in, while small, was a mess. From a student suing the leadership over being dismissed from the program to another student being locked out of the lab by the prof because he was close to graduating and wanted to leave for a postdoc to just weird and diabolical faculty that should never mentor students and a bunch of other stories - I was glad to finish and get the hell out of there. I actually went to law school with the intent to become an advocate for grad students and post docs, but decided for now on a more traditional job. Especially foreign students and post docs are often under tremendous pressure because they are on a visa and some faculty abuse that fact. To be clear, I am not saying anything like was the case here - but I have certainly seen that issue repeatedly during my life, even one faculty member stating that he had that leverage with visa-based scholars.",2023-08-30 16:41:49,5

OwO But, the issue is that I really wanted a single room for, umm, some p-pwivacy. アニメやかわいい日本のものが大好きで、抱き枕も持ってるんだ (I love anime and cute Japanese things, and I even have a dakimakura). I'm not into anything w-weird, I just wanna have my kawaii anime posters and figuwines and cuddle my piwwow without feeling all shy and self-conscious in front of my woommates. でも、枕を抱きながら眠るのが一番快適なんだよ (But cuddling my pillow while sleeping is the most comfortable). Nyan~ 💤 I know UNC is, w-well, known for being pwogwessive and accepting, but I can't help but have this w-worwy that my woommates might judge me and giggle behind my back fow snuggling with my Dakimakura. こんなに緊張するなんて初めてだよ (I've never been this nervous before), nya~! It's making me all n-nervous just thinking about it! I wouldn't wanna deal with some wannabe frat bros who don't get my cute intewests and make fun of me, eep! Oh, and by the way, my Dakimakura is a bit, umm, gwaphic and suggestive, hehe. 部屋に入ってビックリさせたくないから、遠いベッドに寝ることを考えたの (I thought about sleeping on the far bed so I don't surprise anyone entering the room). So, umm, what do you guys think?

As a professor and mother of two, I am completely heartbroken. Absolutely shattered by this. I’ve had students tell me that getting appointments at CAPS hasn’t been easy. I’m not pointing the finger at CAPS because I know many who have and are currently getting great care there. But something has to give. I’ve seen so much great support and love on this board…so at the very least I also want to do my part. If anyone needs a prof/mom to hear them out, please message me!

comment,UNC crime log reports another suicide 3 am Sunday at Granville Towers South.,UNC needs to cancel classes or at least have professors stop exams for at least a day to get a handle on this and get resources to students. What occurred yesterday was public and visible to numerous students and this second event shows that the campus is in a full fledged crisis. This has turned into the studied phenomena of a suicide-related cluster and could get a lot worse. I'm fielding a lot of calls from my fellow classmates who are in crisis over trying to deal with this and midterms tomorrow and this week. Our hearts are broken. We need help.

It's certainly not going to improving mental health resources on campus or to fixing the numerous issues with technology and accessibility on campus! &#x200B; I'm infuriated with this school for the total lack of support after now THREE suicides on campus- the number is only going to continue climbing if the university doesn't make some changes.",2021-10-10 13:03:50,62

I am a '96 UNC alum who was involved in Greek life and saw positive and negative from it, and I am a parent of a current junior there who I am constantly trying to de-stress about not ""getting in"" to the ""perfect"" major or grad school, yet he is surrounded by peers telling him that only *X major and grad school* will net him a ""successful"" life. Anything else is seen as failure. I don't blame the peers; I think it's indicative of the pressure they feel as well, and some of that was present at Carolina in the 90s when I was there, albeit not to this extent. It's just concerning that all of this is layered on top of kids who have experienced an unprecedented disruption in their lives that has left them feeling hopeless about what lies ahead. We all have to be carefully honed in on this as it seems suicide (attempts are just as awful as they represent the same danger) is also now a public health threat at UNC. &#x200B; *Edited for typos - sorry, still on first morning coffee*",2021-10-10 11:14:29,79

comment,UNC crime log reports another suicide 3 am Sunday at Granville Towers South.,"I think UNC needs to put QMHP INSIDE OF the dorms. Have a whole dorm suite act as a counseling suite and safe space to go to decompress. Bring quality mental health services to students instead of making students schlep to CAPS which is basically good for nothing for a lot of people. If kids are taking their own lives in their dorms, bring mental healthcare TO the dorms. Unfortunately it makes me really sad to say that I have absolutely no faith in UNC admin to make any actionable or impactful changes and do right by those kids who died and students who are alive and struggling :/",2021-10-10 10:28:51,62

comment,UNC crime log reports another suicide 3 am Sunday at Granville Towers South.,"I don’t blame the people at CAPS but UNC for the lack of resources provided to CAPS. After a long wait students get a 30 minute session where they are referred to outside therapist. These are therapists that require months to get an appointment and are then too expensive for the average student. Essentially the system is putting kids into a boiler room with no real help to deal with the stress. These are kids that just went through 4 years of stressful high school to get into UNC so they’re already stretched thin. During orientation parents and kids are told there are ample resources at CAPS to help, and it’s simply not true.",2021-10-11 15:38:00,16

Unc has been playing the whole “let’s wait and see” game with everything, and it’s messing with the Livelihoods of students and families. People are having issues with classes, housing, food concerns, pandemic concerns, funding, mental health services are so backed up/not the best in funding/in general, and the list goes on. I was lucky enough to have professors that actually supported their students (which was probably the only reason I didn’t just drop out from dealing with the many stressors of last year), but so many professors and majors there have such a toxic culture, and it can be so easy to get sucked into that helpless mindset - especially for those living on campus or in the area.

comment,UNC crime log reports another suicide 3 am Sunday at Granville Towers South.,"i don't really see any other solution (that's not a long term, morality-based educational approach) other than something like this: 1. form an organized, mission-based, dedicated group. 2. get some women to act as bait (obviously they would need to know what they're getting into beforehand (they'd agree to join this ""group"" knowing what they're getting into), and should be able to suffer through some light abuse in order to have real evidence the perp is an abuser). 3. they act vulnerable enough to attract abusers and then when something happens they communicate to other group/team members (via hidden radio––this system would be easy to set up tbh) and give them a ""go"" signal. 4. team members locate the person (the details of this location-finding can be figured out) and then ""deliver justice"". whether this means committing the old ultra-violence and cracking some gullivers, or handing over the evidence to the police (LOL (useless)), a lesson will be learned could also get some secret cams on these women to record evidence. then we find the perps family, friends, business connections, etc... track them all down, share the evidence (this wouldn't be hard to do and it just increases effectiveness of this 'program'). and ideally these happenings would be spread around: don't abuse people unless you want to be injured and have information/proof of your abuse spread throughout the internet &#x200B; p.s. if you have a problem with this (perhaps indicated by a downvote) then say why :) please disconfirm my beliefs",2021-10-10 15:57:03,-33

comment,Doctors & Residents,"I think the doctors that we need to be worried about are the old ass doctors that are still stuck in dinosaur time. Or the doctors that are jerks to their residents and are completely dismissive of their findings. I will always appreciate outside of the box thinkers. And those that stand by what they believe in. It’s really not that far fetched to come up with a different diagnosis, and I don’t believe anyone should be treated in a condescending way in regards to that, especially a resident. I’ve had the same issues for over a year. Two different licensed specialists (board certified, highly reputable) gave me two completely different diagnoses. AND, one of these doctors had a resident, he treated his resident in a respectful way, and explained everything he did, why he was doing it, and was asking for her opinion. This is not what I experienced today. I guess I expect more from UNC and their doctors. In addition to the jerk doctor, there was a jerk patient while I was checking in that was being tolerated way too long IMO. He was yelling at the female staff working the front desk, being rude & obnoxious, and kept slamming his hands on the counter. When one of the ladies working the front desk went and got this mans doctor, his demeanor completely changed. He then accused the girls at the front desk of being prejudiced! Idk what happened with this unruly man, but they should’ve told him to kick rocks once he started slamming his hands on the counter!! It’s really not that hard to be a decent human. *To the female resident I’m referring to, don’t sell yourself short. You got this! I could feel the energy change when Dr Jerk dismissed you. After everyone left and you passively circled back around your findings, you’re not wrong!

comment,UNC overdose story,"Also, testing kits from Bunk Police or Dance Safe are illegal in many many places so if you're out & about and find some blow, you're not likely to be able to test what you just bought.

Fentanyl can be in your stuff but unless you get a ""chip"", you wont know its in there. The only way to truly test for fentanyl is to liquefy your substance & test that liquid but come on, who actually does that. Dance safe recommends testing the baggie it came in which could give you some assurances that it's not tainted.

And do you not think that people in other parts of the world don't have limitations that make it hard for them to complete a degree? Americans have a corner on difficulty? I find in American what is called ""hard work"" is different from other places in the world. Moreover, Americans enjoy making their lives harder by worrying about many things outside of their scope of responsibility and then determining that those things are their responsibility. Wether due to a sense of needing to prove themselves as individuals to others, to feel like they as an individual have accomplished something, to have been ""heard/seen"", to avoid ""missing out"" or to another reason all together I am not sure.

One day the Professor asked if anyone had any questions. I raised my hand. Asked if the girls in the back would stop interrupting class all the time and maybe shut up or stay home so the rest of us could learn the material without their bullshit. Professor smiled a bit and said people should be respectful of the whole class and keep their chatter to a minimum. She tried to get mouthy with me after class but I just told her to shut the fuck up, that it was a college lecture and she could talk to her friends any other time but nobody was paying tuition to listen to her crap. Rest of the semester was pretty quiet.",2023-09-15 14:51:21,23

comment,Grad Student Senate passes no-confidence resolutions,"I say this as someone who spent a lot of time in and around student government here in both undergrad and graduate school: this is a new kind of situation. On the one hand, I agree with the spirit of the resolutions, the UNC admin should rightfully be called out and castigated for the crap they pull and get away, and Roberts in particular is an abysmally weak leader who is very obviously in the pocket of the BOG/BOT/General Assembly in ways neither Folt nor Guski ever were. (I have less to say about Clemens as, while I’ve engaged with him before, I don’t personally know as much ABOUT him) The converse of this is, contrary to a lot of people’s perceptions of student government here, it is an organization that does a lot of work and advocacy WITHIN the system as it exists. Granted, present mileage may vary and I’m not as keyed in as I used to be, but student government has been a big force in things such as netting additional Campus Health counselors and campus health resources through a minor (but then-popular) fee increase, graduate stipend advocacy, and forging cooperation between undergrads and graduate students where they often operate in very siloed conditions otherwise. UNC administration is a beast, but it’s a beast we do sometimes have to work with to get tangible things achieved, though that doesn’t excuse their actions. This pair of resolutions is going to make getting into those meeting spaces and having conversations about policies that can benefit students a lot harder, and the cooperative relationships that may have been there are going to be that much harder to maintain/repair. I understand there’s a strong argument for refusing to work with the admin (ESPECIALLY when they act against majority student interests). But there are those in the admin who do still care about students, and these resolutions are going to make their jobs working with us a lot harder, as they receive their marching orders from the higher ups like Roberts and Clemens. Overall my goal with this isn’t to sway anyone’s thoughts on the matter, but just to say it’s a new direction from student government from what I’ve observed previously and I don’t know entirely how it’ll play out. Cheers y’all",2024-10-10 23:23:10,52

comment,Grad Student Senate passes no-confidence resolutions,"The ignorance here is crazy. Free speech applies to everyone. If you want to be able to protest, organize, meet freely without being “brutalized” (nice hyperbole), then far-right groups also have that right. If you want far-right voices silence, you can’t be mad when your voice is also silenced. And as a Democrat, I want those far-right voices to be able to be heard. I want to know exactly what these people are thinking and planning, I want to be able to engage in discourse with them, I want to be able to respond to their thoughts and beliefs. If its “triggering” to hear viewpoints that you perceive as racist or bigoted or “white supremacist”, then you need to grow up because millions of Americans agree with those viewpoints and they all vote.

comment,Grad Student Senate passes no-confidence resolutions,"Many people expressed those concerns.

Of course, the future is always uncertain, but given how much admin has continued to show disdain for students' voices, the majority of Senate decided that making decisions out of fear and establishing a precedent of bending to the will of the chancellor and vice chancellor would betray their constituents and not bode well for student government in the long run.",2024-10-10 23:27:50,39

comment,UNC Students' Reaction To The Fall Announcement,"How so? The cost of providing an online education is not equivalent to one given on campus.

comment,UNC Students' Reaction To The Fall Announcement,"I would ideally say students could watch lectures at their leisure, as long as they meet work deadlines. Flexibility will be everyone's friend in these trying times. The work wouldn't be doubled, in-class lectures can be streamed and recorded. Surely we have the technology to do this, it seems one of the least difficult aspects. I think all students will get a bump in grade regardless. Many profs do this in a normal semester if you put the work in or show you're trying. What if for certain classes all exams were take home. It doesn't matter too much if your final is writing an essay or two. For other classes just spread the work load throughout the semester. It just takes some creative thinking, I don't profess to have all the answers. I do however, expect the school that I pay thousands of dollars to come up with the answers. Basis the ongoing communication from the school, it appears they are planning for all eventualities anyway. I'm simply providing my reaction and what I would prefer.",2020-05-22 16:04:30,4
comment,UNC Students' Reaction To The Fall Announcement,"I mean just in terms of the price. I understand the idea that the quality might not be as good, but I think that's based on the instructor. Given time and a proper lesson plan it could be just as good as in person. (A lot of spring's suckfest was because profs had an online course plopped in their lap mid-semester and adapted best they could - some better than others). An online class at UNC is $237/credit hour. Full time in state tuition is 195-292/credit hour. (Lower price is for 18 hours, upper for 12 hours). So if you take a full load of online courses that would range from 2844 to 4266 depending on your load, based on current rates, which I'm pretty sure are set by state law. That means if you're taking around 15 hours online, you're breaking even *in terms of cost.* If you're taking 12-15 hours you're ""owed"" a refund of about 600 and more than 15 hours and you're actually getting a deal. There's tradeoffs for everything. Learning on Zoom (which was never designed for education) sucks, but at least you don't have to worry about parking or pants and can just fuck around on your phone for an hour.

Nearly half the dorm dragged their old mattress down to the room to trade in for a new one. An RA got wind and made everyone put them back. This was when Teague was all male and a hell-raiser dorm (think Animal House). Within 2 years, after some incident, the RHA threw out all residents from the dorm and made it coed, totally destroying the history of the dorm. Teague alumni were planning on raising money for a scholarship, but that ceased with the dorm change. But I digress… So many stories. Your Momma Sleeps in Teague 08 Teague",2024-12-03 01:34:40,45

post,Friendly reminder about rule 1,"Friendly reminder about rule 1 We try to be as hands-off as possible here, but following two really scary events in a row I’ve been a little more active. While I acknowledge that in the United States we have the right to freedom of speech, this is a moderated online community. We have made rules and have the right to enforce them. Rule 1 is to be kind. If you have opinions regarding gun control and feel compelled to share them here, that’s your right. Please do keep in mind that many students here are still processing and recovering from losing a faculty member to gun violence and then having to go into lockdown only a short time later. If your profile is made exclusively to share right-wing views on gun control, and then you suddenly come to this sub to push those views aggressively and disrespectfully, that is not appropriate. That is not what this community is for and there is a plethora of other subreddits for that. Moreover, if you suddenly become active here to push those views while calling students and faculty cruel names, insulting their intelligence and personhood, you will be banned. Have some tact.",2023-09-15 13:48:05,238

comment,Friendly reminder about rule 1,"More tangential ramblings: Trauma looks different for everyone. Locking down, or having friends locked down, or wondering if your friends are alive, is traumatic for some and not for others. Both of those responses are valid and deeply personal. This may also bring up emotions of past trauma for some, causing Monday’s and August’s events to be traumatic for one and not for another.

comment,Friendly reminder about rule 1,"Just wanted to add, not all liberals hate guns. I’m liberal and I don’t hate them. As someone who grew up in a family of hunters and even hunted occasionally, and having served in the military, I’ve been around guns for decades. I’m by no means a weapons expert, but I’m familiar with some firearms. Gun control doesn’t equal taking guns away. The vast majority of gun control advocates just want common sense laws and for gun owners to be responsible gun owners and take accountability for their guns. When I was in the military, you had to know where your firearm was at all times, if there was an accidental discharge or any other accident involving your firearm, you were held accountable and punished,regardless of whether you pulled the trigger or not. When I used to work at a police department, I saw countless police reports of children getting hurt because someone left a gun out and they got it. That gun owner should be held responsible for that. To legally operate vehicles we have to register them and be licensed to drive them which requires us to learn all about the safe handling of them, why can’t it be the same for firearms?",2023-09-15 16:10:51,29

People, I’m not saying you specifically are, but a lot are just using the “if we give them an inch” mentality to fear monger support to not allow any sort of reform. Liberals know full well that mass removal of weapons from citizens is a nonstarter, the votes to pass those types of laws just aren’t there. But for so many gun owners to so adamantly oppose any type of legislation reform is so off putting. Whether they mean to or not, by refusing to consider any type of reform, they’re telling everyone that they think their right to own a gun is more important than the lives of students and faculty.",2023-09-15 17:20:22,8

I used to have a no-questions-asked absence policy if you had reasonable - unforeseen - personal reasons (e.g. death in the family / illness), and then that policy got taken advantage of. Making up an exam for a student who has bad luck is OK. Having to organize two or more exams for students who planned a vacation a bit too early, or realized too late they didn't prepare adequately, is just extra work on my end. It is also offering an unfair evaluation that puts at a disadvantage the other students who follow the agreed upon schedule. As a result, I have reverted to asking students to let the university decide what is and isn't a reasonable absence, by only accepting university-sanctioned absences.

post,"DO NOT Donate to any of the ""Charities"" on Campus!","DO NOT Donate to any of the ""Charities"" on Campus! Lately, I've been seeing more and more ""charities"" set up around campus, such as ASDF (Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation) and ACCBF (American Childrens Cancer Benevolence Fund). This is your heads up that these organizations are some of the scummiest charity institutions that exist. They spend exuberant amounts on marketing and on the stands you see around campus (around 90% of donations they collect go towards this cause) and very little is actually spent towards relief. They target college students with sob stories and aggressively ask for up-front donations so that you give them money before doing any research. Before giving to any organization, ALWAYS do your own research, bottom line. The fact that they're allowed to set up here is annoying by itself, but they show no signs of stopping, so please... don't waste your money.",2023-11-14 16:08:11,224
comment,"DO NOT Donate to any of the ""Charities"" on Campus!","Yeah, I was admittedly someone unfortunate enough to fall for this. And like, I NEVER THOUGHT I would be that person! It just happened so fast. The guy came out from my peripheral vision and started wanting to shake my hand. That was how they get you. It kind of kicks you into a freeze or flight response. I froze and then next thing I know I was getting pulled off to the side and giving him my name. To increase his credibility as he pulls me off to the side, he gestures and says something along the lines of “let’s step off to the side here to where my associates are helping other students.” I look and there are in fact other students there talking with other people. Somehow this makes my brain think this is an okay thing. That I’m not alone. I had a few dollars left over from lunch and I was thinking okay, I can just donate this. BUT NO! Next he tells me they only take credit cards! My brain should have kicked in here and told me to just leave but it was weird in that it didn’t. I had committed myself kind of already and I just didn’t know how to back out (it was the weirdest thing ever as my brain was just ignoring all the red flags). By this point my mind is mush. I’ve already committed and I think okay fine, I’ll just donate like $10. Here’s where I majorly f*cked up. I let them scan my credit card which they wanted to do first before deciding on an amount. Like he didn’t specifically say anything about amount. He just said okay let me get your credit card info and my mindless brain was like “okay, here.” Then they pull up a screen that shows the donation options. I kid you not the lowest option on that screen was $100.00 and the highest was $500.00! At this point I was panicking internally. Like I said things were happening so fast and in retrospect I’m just stunned. Anyway I said something like “ I’m a college student do you have anything less?” The guy replies yeah and says they have $30 and $50 dollar donation options. I went with the $30 but I imagine if I had been thinking better I could have got it lower to like $15. Showing high amounts to start is a known marketing tactic as it’s easier to convince someone to go with a lower (but still high amount) if they think they are lucking out and not paying a very high amount. Granted, If I had had any brainpower I would have just ignored him when he approached me but it was after a long day of back to back classes and so I didn’t have much brainpower left. This is probably me just trying to rationalize my stupidity, however. Anyway, I googled ASDF after the fact and saw that they had a bad reputation for aggressive solicitations and not spending much on the actual people they claim to help which was just like the cherry on top for my experience. But I guess the point I’m trying to make is that this can happen to anyone no matter how prepared you think you are to resist their tactics. I mean, their literal job is to overcome your resistance and get money. You just have to stand firm and not feel bad about ignoring people who approach you. I mean they literally come to college to prey on you, on us, as college students. Stand firm and ignore any and all a**holes that approach you and just go to class. That’s the world we live in unfortunately. Unless you’re capable of resisting their tactics, but like I said you always think that before they get you.",2023-11-14 16:39:16,60

comment,"DO NOT Donate to any of the ""Charities"" on Campus!",I called them immediately after donating & researching them and the woman on the phone told me that they went against policy by taking my card and making up a minimum donation so it was refunded.

post,"10 years ago, I was at UNC as an exchange student","10 years ago, I was at UNC as an exchange student I visited from Copenhagen, Denmark. I made many amazing friends during my stay. My time there has stayed with me, and I hope I also made lasting impressions on some of the great people I met. Since, there have been many Danish students at UNC and many UNC students in Denmark. It seems to be a great match between the warm, easygoing North Carolina hospitality and our straightforward, curious Danish way of being. Yesterday, your president threatened to invade and annex Greenland, which makes up almost all of the land mass of the kingdom of Denmark. This is just short of declaring war on Denmark - a country that has stood as a close ally of the United States for nearly a century. Danes have fought and died alongside Americans in Afghanistan and Iraq, including friends and family members of mine. We are also a fellow NATO member. I became a dad three months ago, and I have to confess that Trump and his foreign policy are by far my single biggest worry for my little daughter's future. It's heartbreaking and bewildering to see that North Carolina voted for this. A man who threatens the right to exist for Greenland, Ukraine, even Canada. I hope you understand that this has far-reaching consequences, even for friends you may or may not have made years ago from across the planet.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ I hope you find the strength to resist and fight.",2025-03-05 16:36:07,217

comment,"10 years ago, I was at UNC as an exchange student","Unfortunately the recently elected president of the United States is an embarrassment to both himself, our nation and the international community. The fact alone that a felon, a convicted sexual abuser, and twice impeached pathological liar came back into the white house is beyond reasonable belief. Trump has been systematically mass programming a large swath of American people to the point where they revere him, without being able to critically self think. Trump loves chaos, and unpredictability. He surrounds himself with extremists that influence him daily. He truly is a disgrace for our country. Having said all that, I am convinced that greenland, panama, canada etc is all part of his usual grandstanding where he makes a lot of noise of perceived leadership to appease his now-mass programmed base and to do absolutely nothing, but will claim some sort of deal (remember he wrote this crappy book the art of the deal).

At the same time, if you read project 2025, there’s a plan for declaring martial law in response to civil unrest. The secretary of defense said he would not promise he would not use the military against protestors during the confirmation hearing. So is your suggestion we should be rioting in the street so we can get shot and Trump can consolidate power and declare martial law? Seriously, we’re all ears if you have a better plan.",2025-03-06 17:51:58,3

We would love to protest more at the collegiate level, but Trump threatening that he would freeze university funds and have students get expelled if they protest regarding certain topics has a lot of ppl scared, especially when they rely on scholarships for their education.

Also, please stop saying that ‘you guys voted for this,’ when only 1/3 of the country actually voted for Trump.

post,Just wanted to share,"Just wanted to share Just wanted to share I talked about everything that happened this week with my therapist yesterday. I’ve really been struggling with feeling valid in what I was feeling because I wasn’t on campus when it happened, my friends weren’t on campus when it happened, I wasn’t hurt, my friends weren’t hurt, ect… I felt like I didn’t deserve to feel affected. But my therapist made a really good point that helped me understand how I was feeling. When 9/11 happened, people all over the country felt affected, even if they weren’t directly involved or knew anyone who was directly involved. For me that made it click that even though I wasn’t on campus when it happened, my community was affected, the place where I’ve always felt safe no longer felt safe, so I was affected and my feelings are totally valid.

Despite being completely safe, there is something just awful about knowing that you could have been there, that it could have been you, that there's no way to tell a regular day apart from that kind of day, and that you were one or two different decisions away from being there.

I felt similar ones being on lockdown in uptown but one thing I came to terms with that helped me process my feelings is how far and wide a tragedy like this ripples. It’s similar to having your car or home broken into—a place you felt safe, comfortable, and at ease has now been defiled and feels unknown and scary. Your proximity to the actual shooting doesn’t change this. One thing that has stuck with me all these years in the wake of our shooting is the thought of how many students like myself were in other places but still feel this so deeply? What about recent alum, parents, friends of students, anyone who is once removed and is feeling this too? What about the people who live in Charlotte, who aren’t even students or know students? Something like this affects so many people beyond the obvious and your feelings and emotions are valid. I am thinking of the Carolina community and send my love and well wishes.

We didn’t know what was going to happen and even if our direct friends weren’t impacted necessarily, our community was. It makes our home feel unsafe.

I've felt the same invalidating feelings, so you're not alone. But following the news on Monday made me feel the same hopeless fear as October 2022. I found myself obsessing over who the shooter was, checking out his social media accounts, etc. Constantly checking for press conferences, texting people in Chapel Hill every 20 minutes. I haven't really talked to anyone about it, and have just tried to go through my week as normal. I'm so tired of feeling threatened and on edge about the next news coverage of an event like this.

post,BEWARE: Barnes Towing,"BEWARE: Barnes Towing Just graduated from UNC, and living in Carborro. Here is some serious advice for my fellow tar heels: If you see a parking lot with ""Barnes Towing"", **do not park there.** This includes Carr mill, Mcdonalds on Franklin, Panera on franklin, and many others. The parking fees are **$360** plus a daily fee. Barnes towing will tow your car, even if you are shopping at the place the parking is for. If you step off the lot, even to just go buy a burrito or something across the street, your car **WILL** be towed in minutes. I haven't personally been towed, but many of my friends have, and they have had to pay obscene fees and also go very far out of town to a random shady spot near governers club just to get their cars back.

comment,BEWARE: Barnes Towing,"They’re INSANELY predatory. I used to DoorDash in Chapel Hill and would witness Barnes extorting people with their wheels capped every single day at McDonalds and Panera. They have cameras and/or scouts at each location, so you can have your wheels capped within a minute after stepping off site. If you can’t afford to pay off the driver in the moment, you’ll be looking at $500-800 by the time you get your vehicle back from them. If you can manage it, boycott places that contract with Barnes in the area.",2024-08-21 22:33:49,47

Thinking it was far fetched, I did some internet sleuthing and sure enough I went to get my car back and demanded to be billed. I had to get police involved but sure enough got my car back, drove away and never paid a cent. Reasoning behind this is if you sincerely can't pay and then incur a huge amount of storage fees making it even more impossible to pay, they can't just keep your car.

comment,BEWARE: Barnes Towing,You know how many times as a chapel hill resident who didn't go to unc I got blocked into the Chipotle parking lot because kids thought it was okay to double park and than walk over to Panera. It's a small downtown there's not alot of space. People do that stuff all the time and hence towing is enforced. There's big lots on the backside of Franklin if your going to park and walk around or go to multiple places while in downtown. Those parking lots are meant for 15 minute parking so everyone can go there. Not park at Chipotle and do your school work for 5 hours. Cause I've seen that to. That's the massive probably. Maybe some unfortunate people were towed on accident after not being inconsiderate fucks. But majority of the people downtown don't have any regard for anyone else and I gladly moved from orange county because of Franklin Street and how miserable it was to get to anything since every food establishment within 20 minutes of my house was on Franklin and I was sick of fratt houses and college kids running everywhere being ignorant,2024-08-23 09:31:12,-8

comment,BEWARE: Barnes Towing,"I get what you're saying and honestly I agree, parking enforcement is important in an area that is built for pedestrians. That is why I support the model that like nearly every parking lot in CH uses which is metered parking. The problem with Barnes is twofold. Firstly, they're incredibly predatory, charging insane rates and they sit waiting for people to walk off property for even a minute. Secondly, they actually tow cars EVEN if the owner is on the premises. This is illegal, but nothing is really done about it. I posted a comment with an anecdotal account of a customer being towed while at venable in carborro, and also the articles i posted talk about this as well. Additionally, perhaps instead of using these towing services which should be illegal, perhaps tickets or more affordable boots should be in order prior to towing which has a steeper fine than a traffic violation or disable illegal park. It's ridiculous, it's extrajudicial fines that are absolutely and unrealistically high with no real means to challenge it or have any sort of nuance or understanding.",2024-08-22 13:46:11,8

comment,BEWARE: Barnes Towing,"The vast majority of people towed, at the least the ones I've seen or spoken to, do technically leave the lot. It's usually only for a few minutes, and they may have patronized the business on the lot prior to leaving. But they do leave the lot, if only for a brief time. Of course, Barnes towing are still tremendous predatory assholes. My point is just that if you park on the business lot, walk into the business and walk out, and don't go anywhere else, you should be fine. Of course, if you didn't want to risk it I wouldn't blame you.

The articles I posted talk about this, and also just a few days ago someone posted on FB about getting towed while eating at venable. I'll copy the post here from FB: Wanted to give parents a heads up we ate at Venable tonight and took our daughter for FDOC dinner. We took 2 cars as my husband works in Durham has a 1st responded call Vehicle. His truck was towed while we were eating. A guy named Nathan Milian who lives in Maryland watches on the Camaras to see if people misuse the parking lot. We did not misuse parking lot we ate dinner, we did not park close to the restaurant as his truck is bigger sized it was at the end of the lot. Still legally parked. Do not eat at any of the establishments in that parking lot you will get towed, we did not know of these issues or we would not have eaten there. There is an article on this and how they are towing people. The sign states we can park there if we are eating, this is costing $360 or $280 cash this is the carr mill mall parking lot. Yes we only ate there. I wanted to give new parents like ourself a heads up.",2024-08-21 23:42:27,29

I posted a comment with an anecdotal account of a customer being towed while at venable in carborro, and also the articles i posted talk about this as well. Additionally, perhaps instead of using these towing services which should be illegal, perhaps tickets or more affordable boots should be in order prior to towing which has a steeper fine than a traffic violation or disable illegal park. It's ridiculous, it's extrajudicial fines that are absolutely and unrealistically high with no real means to challenge it or have any sort of nuance or understanding. These obscene fees don't work as a deterrent more than any other normal fee would, and they have other crazy things like $100 a day holding fees and a $80 up charge for using card. Like, be so for real.",2024-08-23 09:41:33,6

comment,BEWARE: Barnes Towing,"Basically they gave me this form to fill out. Address, phone, 3 references, etc. Everything I put in was fake. I didn't care. Cops had to tell them to release my car because it was the law. Yes, tow company could have gone to collections with a bunch of fake info, but I could care less. Thus varies state to state. I'm sure so look up yours and see your rights.",2024-08-26 00:37:03,2

comment,BEWARE: Barnes Towing,">I get what you're saying and honestly I agree, parking enforcement is important in an area that is built for pedestrians Wait that's not what I'm saying... I'm saying towing people because they parked at one business and shopped at a different business is archaic thinking. Rising tide lifts all boats. The more spending occurring on Franklin St is good for all businesses there. Customers are more likely to return and if a customer can comfortably leave their car for 15 minutes then they're more likely to spend more money. To be perfectly clear, I am 100% anti-Barnes and my comment is directed toward the people who will inevitably show up and try to justify the towing.",2024-08-22 13:56:37,7

comment,BEWARE: Barnes Towing,That’s terrible!! Nathan Milian is the awful property manager and he lives locally. The property owner whose name I forget is the one who lives in Maryland. He’s pretty awful too. Most of the store owners and workers do not like this policy but Nathan and the owner don’t care. I was in Golden Fig Books when I heard a worker tell other workers about a mom and kids who had come in crying because their car got towed and how the worker had let them go in the back room and settle down and call help. The workers were really upset and mad at the situation too. I do still shop and park at Carr Mill but I do not step foot off the property or even go close to the street. The towns don’t like it either and years ago tried to put a $$ limit on towing but it ended up as a NC Supreme Court case and the towns lost and the Supreme Court ruled that they couldn’t limit the towing costs like that.,2024-08-22 09:08:58,6
comment,BEWARE: Barnes Towing,You realize that if the parking is for a specific business or group that you can’t walk to a different place and think it’s okay right? Even to grab something quick. That’s the whole point. You have brought that up a few times and that is the reason they keep a tow truck near by. They don’t know how long you’re going for and it doesn’t matter if it’s an hour or a minute. Get over yourself ya clown.,2024-08-25 06:02:32,1

comment,BEWARE: Barnes Towing,I’m not defending them I’m saying y’all are acting like you aren’t actively doing the thing it says you can’t do. 5min or 60 it doesn’t matter and the business there are the ones that hire the tow companies to enforce those tow rules…because they don’t want you parking there and going somewhere else. Even for “10min” it’s really not that hard to grasp.,2024-08-25 19:18:44,1

When you’re out jogging, think twice about wearing the short shorts. It’s not just your fellow students looking at you. There are many colorful characters around town. Some harmless… some… not harmless. like Listo-Rick, who drinks Listerine all day in parking decks and back alleys. He’s harmless and in general it’s a safe area.

post,"Here’s the vaccine situation in North Carolina: overall supply, your place in line, how quickly the line might move (Sen. Jeff Jackson)","Here’s the vaccine situation in North Carolina: overall supply, your place in line, how quickly the line might move (Sen. Jeff Jackson) HERE’S THE VACCINE SITUATION IN NORTH CAROLINA This week, North Carolina got 85,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Next week, that will drop to 60,000. Some of you saw the headlines about Pfizer vaccine shipments being reduced, for reasons that are still unclear. That appears to have happened across the board. So, while we were originally expecting to get another 85,000 Pfizer doses, now it looks closer to 60,000. But that doesn’t apply to the Moderna vaccine. Next week, our state will be getting 175,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine - which just became FDA-approved last night, so we now officially have two vaccines. Both vaccines need to be administered with a first and second shot. The shots must be 21 days apart for Pfizer and 28 days apart for Moderna. You cannot mix a Pfizer with a Moderna vaccination - you need two doses of the same kind. These estimates are very rough, but it’s safe to say that within the next six weeks North Carolina will be getting hundreds of thousands (but likely not millions) of doses. But, keep in mind, everyone needs two doses. So, for example, if we get one million doses by the end of January, that means 500,000 immunizations. For context, that’s less than 5% of our state. Many sources, including Dr. Fauci, say that herd immunity kicks in once 75 to 85% of the population is immunized. However, he says that once 50% of the population is immunized we should start to see an effect on slowing community spread. At this point, it’s safe to say that it will be many months before we hit 50%. We may very well end up with much more supply than the current rate, but that’s less likely to happen in the next couple months than in the months that follow. Dr. Fauci, for instance, says we should have greater supply starting in late March or early April. That means that for purposes of controlling the overall rate of infection for the next few months - *which will be crucial* - the vaccine may not be a major counterweight. HERE’S WHERE THE VACCINES ARE HEADING WITHIN OUR STATE RIGHT NOW First, we’re shipping to all the hospitals. We have 116 hospitals in our state. In the first week, we only had enough vaccine to ship to 53 of them, and some of them only received a small number of vaccines. The 53 hospitals that were chosen for the first shipment all have ultra-cold freezers. Novant, for example, had to quickly buy roughly 20 new sub-zero freezers in order to receive the shipment. Once the vaccines are unloaded from their ultra-cold delivery box, they must be moved into a freezer within five minutes. Due to how the vaccine is packaged, the smallest number of Pfizer vaccines that a hospital can receive is 975. You can’t sub-divide that number due to packaging. The Moderna vaccine is different. It doesn’t require ultra-cold storage, just regular freezer storage. That means it can ship in batches of 100. While supplies are still scarce, this makes the Moderna vaccine more well-suited for rural hospitals and smaller providers. *Important Note*: Nursing home distribution works differently. The federal government wanted to give states some flexibility in deciding where vaccines would go *except* when it comes to nursing homes, which they wanted to ensure were a priority. They also wanted to make sure that the administration of the vaccine in nursing homes was handled with particular care. So the approach they came up with was to contract with Walgreens and CVS to use their medical staff to administer the vaccine to nursing homes. And the deal is the federal government will pay for that *as long as* your state allocates at least 50% of the Moderna vaccine to nursing homes. North Carolina has complied with that, so nursing homes will have the benefit of a large number of trained medical staff on site to handle vaccine administration. This does not, however, apply to all forms of long-term care facilities. Right now, this is specifically for nursing homes due to their highly elevated risk. HERE’S HOW THE PHASES WORK (I.E., “YOUR PLACE IN LINE”) The CDC established guidelines for how states should prioritize vaccine distribution. North Carolina has adopted those guidelines. 1a: Health care workers specifically dealing with COVID (note: this also includes clerical and janitorial staff working in COVID wings) and residents/staff of long-term care facilities. 1b: Adults with at least two chronic conditions that put them at severe risk, and front-line workers at high risk of exposure. 2: Adults over 65, adults under 65 with at least one chronic condition, and front-line workers. 3: College students, K-12 students (when a vaccine is approved for children under 16, which hasn’t happened yet), and essential workers at lower risk of exposure. 4: Everyone else who wants a vaccine. The most recent estimate is that we may reach group 1b by mid-January. It depends entirely on whether we continue to receive the vaccine at the rate we expect. 1b is a vastly larger pool of individuals than 1a, so unless we start receiving the vaccine more quickly it will likely take much longer to get through 1b. BOTTOM-LINE It’s important to stress that the big variable here - how quickly we get more vaccine - is very difficult to predict. That said, at this point it appears the baseline scenario is that it could be many months before we've immunized enough people for it to become a major limiting factor for community spread. That means this is still largely up to us, as individuals. We still owe it to each other to keep infection chains as short as possible. *Our vigilance is the bridge to the vaccine.* ONE MORE THING In the meantime, it would be extremely helpful if the U.S. Senate would pass the COVID relief bill they’ve been debating for the last several months so we can get financial help to people while we ask them to stay safe and stay smart. The state of North Carolina - like most states - is highly dependent on federal assistance in this circumstance and our state legislature has been waiting since August to get this help. Assuming they reach a deal soon, I’ll update you on how that relief is being deployed. - Sen. Jeff Jackson",2020-12-18 13:34:54,211

comment,UNC Gave Zayden High A Slap On The Wrist For Sexual Misconduct,I'm not gonna quibble over wording or legality here. None of that is even particularly relevant since this is about how UNC dealt with it internally. I would hope that this kind of behavior would result in expulsion because as you said it is both criminal and extremely fucking gross. The fact that UNC let him get off with a slap on the wrist is both an indictment of the university's age old issue with not handling this kind of stuff well and the fact that they're willing to let him get away with this behavior because he's important to the program. Don't get it twisted. If you've ever had to deal with Honor Court like I have this kind of slap on the wrist is genuinely laughable given how self serious the university takes honor code violations.,2025-05-02 13:01:46,16

comment,My day just got better...,"Folks, *the r-word does not belong on this sub.* For those who are not familiar with its history, it comes from an obsolete era of medicine and has since been used to dehumanize and disrespect individuals with intellectual disabilities. It is not acceptable terminology within the medical or research professions today. And even if it was the right term, (1) it's ableist to tell people they have a disability as if it is something to be ashamed of, and (2) it's clearly not nice to the person you are saying it to and devalues them as a person. I'm not even sure why we are bringing up the Holocaust in the thread, but if you are going to talk about it on this sub you need to remember that it was a serious tragedy where millions of people lost their lives, and entire religious, ethnic, and other communities were destroyed and permanently affected up until today (wtf does this even need to be said). It's not a joke to the people who lost family members or lived through it, and it shouldn't be a joke here. No, someone who is happy about people getting in trouble for Covid whether you think they should be or not would not ""be happy about Jewish people being caught,"" and I guarantee you they wouldn't.

comment,My day just got better...,"Why are people happy when they see in the news that a criminal was apprehended? IDK how it is at your university but especially considering the amount of chaos and embarrassment to our school caused by the second-week shutdown last fall, most students and faculty here are very concerned and interested in holding themselves and the administration accountable. IMO, it is completely reasonable for people who have had their lives and possibly their families' lives greatly disrupted by this pandemic to expect that other students who don't follow the rules are held accountable and to feel good when they do. Personally, in less extreme classes I would give them the chance to take all their classes online from here until the end of the public health emergency status, rather than completely disenrolling them, but either way they know the rules and know the consequences and nothing on this account shows a minor ""bending the rules"" but a clear violation of exactly what they are supposed to prevent.",2021-01-30 14:44:48,7

comment,My day just got better...,"Do not come here from that ""new normal"" sub just to say that people who complain/report about Covid rule violators are the same as literal Nazi sympathizers. That will almost certainly be incredibly offensive to Jewish people, other groups and people that were victims of the Holocaust, and of course to the people you are attacking with this comment. There are plenty of valid considerations in deciding whether or not to report someone for breaking a rule or law and it is fine to share your viewpoint on that. Personally, I tend to lean on the side of let's do whatever we can to keep our school from shutting down again and people from getting sick (the rule here is 10 ppl max for indoor gatherings and most of these photos clearly exceed that by a long shot), but it's fine if you wouldn't choose to report them yourself. No law that says you have to and no rule that you can't explain your ethical reasoning for doing so here. What is not fine is saying that someone who is reporting another for violating a lawfully issued executive order/community standard is the same as being an accessory to a crime against humanity. It is not acceptable for you to use that to attack people on this sub for asking that others follow the laws here, using a real historical tragedy as a sort of edgy hyperbole.",2021-01-29 22:58:05,16

post,I am stunned,I am stunned I am stunned. I'm an NC resident with a 4.0 and extracurriculars who applied to transfer as a sophomore and got denied. I am SO confused.

comment,I am stunned,"I say this with the utmost respect and sympathy. You'll be alright. Really. You will. The Carolina admissions team didn't think that this school would have been the best choice for you rn and that's alright. Pick yourself up and move on. There are hundreds into thousands of other students with your exact stats or better who did or did not get accepted. At the end of the day, seats are limited and the university is already bursting at the seams with students. Go somewhere else and do your 100% there. Then, maybe, apply for transfer over here. Or stay there and do your 100% wherever you go but I guarantee you that as long as you work hard and be smart, you will not care in 5+ years that you did not get accepted into UNC. Shoot, you might even be thankful that you didn't get accepted. But I wish you the best of luck!",2025-04-17 17:22:29,33

comment,I am stunned,"Respectfully, if these are what you consider the most important factors then there’s a few reasons I can see why you wouldn’t be given a seat. You’re probably an amazing student, but admissions committees look at more than stats. Does your personality make you a good fit for the community at this moment? Are you able to convey a personality through your writing? Does the school need more people going into the field you’re seeking? As an alumni, I’m sorry to see this because I can tell you really wanted it, but at the same time consider there may actually be a school better fit for you.

comment,I am stunned,It’s a lot more difficult to transfer after only one year. Two years is the norm. Try it again. And stop fretting. Undergrad really doesn’t matter. Grad school rankings matter a lot more for employment. Not the same for undergrad. At all.,2025-04-19 07:24:25,5
comment,I am stunned,UNC is more competitive than ever. There are more students vying for admission and the acceptance rate has never been lower. Our son just got in with a 4.55 gpa and 1580 sat. Back in my day that would have been Ivy League.,2025-04-17 16:38:47,13
comment,I am stunned,"A cursory google search will show you that UNC uses a holistic approach in admissions. This means while it may be amazing to have a 4.0 and a list of extra, that's not all they're looking for. What will you ADD to UNC? What's your story beyond a good GPA and the fact you were president of the chess club? In other words, UNC wants students who are more than an academic robot.",2025-04-18 11:32:21,9
comment,I am stunned,I just want to say I’m really sorry to hear that. I think if you keep your 4.0 and apply as a junior transfer you will get in next year though. Keep crushing it and good things will happen,2025-04-17 17:49:50,9

comment,I am stunned,"The sad reality is that nobody is entitled a spot at any university, especially not UNC or other T20s. That's why people warn anyone applying to these kinds of schools that a 4.0 and tons of clubs will never be enough to get in. However, I genuinely dont think you're missing out on much even if you don't believe it right now. I've been a student at a variety of schools, and some of my best classes were by CC professors and AP high school teachers (none of my UNC professors have been better than my AP teachers). The academics here are very rigorous, and a lot of the ""opportunities"" you need to be connected to access. The actual resources, like free tutoring and academic coaching/advising, aren't that good imo either. You were clearly very successful in community college and likely high school too, so I'm sure you'll make the best out of the next institution you attend—that's what it's really about anyway.",2025-04-18 12:25:00,8
comment,I am stunned,"UNC is just very picky on transfer apps, I think. A fairly long time ago but I applied in with the exact same resume as you (although idk about your high school case, which weighs pretty heavily), and got accepted by UVA and NC State but not UNC. As another person mentioned, if you really want to go to UNC (especially if you're currently at CC or another UNC system school) you should apply again next year. If you're not at one of those types of institutions, the decision might be trickier.",2025-04-17 19:29:32,3
comment,I am stunned,"I just got rejected too, but it’s all good. I had a 2.83 out of junior college cumulated over many years. I went to school at first because I had to if I wanted financial support. When I finally decided to take it seriously, I got good grades to help compensate for the lost years and also had pretty serious extenuating circumstances from familial trauma over many years which was comforting to write about in my applications. Thankfully, I have gotten in to schools like Auburn and LSU. Still waiting on a few. I applied to UNC because they have a good journalism/communications program as I am an aspiring sports analyst. I hope you get into other great options that perhaps God is steering you towards a better direction that will work out for your good, even if it isn’t what you had originally hoped for. It’ll all work out. :)",2025-04-18 01:26:22,5

comment,I am stunned,It probably had less to do with your 4.0 and more to do with your other activities. Many schools look at grades and think ok. what else do they bring to the table.

comment,I am stunned,"I am sorry for and also surprised by how people have responded to you. I graduated from UNC over 10 years ago and I took this route. 4.0 gpa and transferred in as a Sophomore So speaking from someone with actual experience with what you were pursuing, I would say that GPA is actually important and a 4.0 is necessary but the sort of ""secret"" criteria that no one thinks about is how many of your credits will be transferrable. I came in for Fall 2010 for my sophomore year and did the transfer student's orientation and they HAMMERED into us that we should do everything in our power to graduate ""on time."" Unlike NCSU where a good number of the students have a rigorous engineering program that almost guarantees students take more than 4 years to graduate, UNC is most known for being a flagship university. They are quite conscious of the statistic of how many students graduated ""late"" or in more than 4 years. I felt very pushed to take summer classes (which I did) and pretty heavy workloads during the Fall and Spring semesters. So it might've been how many credits were transferrable? That, and the fact that you are applying in the most competitive and controversial time. I have no idea who/ what is reviewing the applications, but when I did it I KNOW that they weren't using AI (again I did this 15 years ago).",2025-04-20 08:07:59,3

Where you really want to ball out is when you work on getting your master's degree or your doctorate, then I can see why applying and getting accepted into Chapel Hill or Duke University would be important. Otherwise any state school you go to is good enough, and we'll get the job done. I promise you when you go applying for jobs, the hiring manager won't really give a damn.

comment,"Hey y’all, I just had a wild, crazy idea",Coming from a fully vaccinated individual: it seems as tho even with vaccines things just keep going downhill.

Getting the vaccine makes your delta experience much much better, you're way less likely to wind up in the hospital. &#x200B; People gotta follow the protocols - and if more people got the vaccine that would really help too.

post,"So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish","So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish &#x200B; [Time to hit the old dusty trail.](https://i.redd.it/kb3367wx92w81.gif) Today (again!) is my last day as a humble moderator. Time for me to hang up my ban-hammer and let someone else be a jerk to you people. It's been a fun and inspiring run. Being so plugged into the community as a mod over these past couple of bat-shit insane years has shown me a lot of things that college students go through that I, as a old guy, wouldn't. So, on my way out the door - some words of advice: 1. [Wear sunscreen, in general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI). 2. Don't put off things to the last minute. College is training you for adulthood. Bosses can tell when you phone it in. If you're not inspired to do things early, that's a pretty good sign that subject isn't something you should spend your life doing so take that as an opportunity to reevaluate your major. 3. Don't let one student do all the work in a group project. Help out. Even if you have other things/papers/projects going on chime in a say ""Hey, this is on the back burner now but I promise to do X, Y, Z."" 4. Use Canva for presentations! Put a little sizzle and humor in your work. Don't just read off the bullet points. Your prof should appreciate some personality. 5. Take. a day. off. if you need to. Grown folks do this and you don't get perfect attendance awards at UNC so might as well. 6. Raise your hand. Ask/Answer a question. You don't have to be right all the time. Being wrong or getting corrected won't be the end of the world. Professors are cool with this concept. Most don't demand perfection. That's the point of class. 7. When a mental health crisis rocked campus last fall, you banded together and made sure people noticed. Don't get distracted by token days off the Administration throws at you. Keep pushing for real change in this and other systemic issues. BUT, don't just shout. Have a plan and measurable goals. The powers that be will be more likely to help and change if you can tell them specifically what you want (and make that what you want realistic but expect incremental change at best). 8. Put your phone down while crossing the street. 9. Don't feel like you're alone or are the only ones experiencing the emotion you're experiencing. Others have. Others are. Others are here to support you. 10. Fuck Duke. Now and forever more. Amen. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for being (mostly) cool, kind, and understanding over the past couple of years. Congratulations to the Class of 2022 and to all the classes to come. TAR!",2022-04-27 09:21:55,202

comment,"We did it! UNC Chapel Hill will give out free physical One Cards at no cost for students, faculty and staff to use as voter ID","I don’t dispute that NCGOP is trying to disenfranchise residents, but student ID’s have a strong precedent here for voting ID and are explicitly mentioned in legislation (https://ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_163/GS_163-166.18.html) so it’s very unlikely that they would be able to legally do that without removing that statute I linked. What NCGOP tried to do here is wait until the last minute and then raise a stink about the definitions in that statute with regard to digital cards, in the hopes that a judge would pause the use of digital cards in this election and they’d hope it might be too much of a bother to students to go buy a physical card. Instead, UNC is just issuing physical cards so it can’t be an issue. Even that challenge was kind of a coin flip for the Republican legislators because the statute doesn’t say that the ID has to be a physical card, and the digital ID technology is extremely sound and secure (frankly, it’s more secure than a physical ID card). All the legislature has to do for next time is clarify the definition of a student ID in the above statute and this won’t happen again.",2024-09-19 10:24:47,8

comment,"We had a good run, y’all.. 1 week.","Here's my thoughts as a freshman. Just to be clear, I completely agree that it is silly to be doing risky things, let along things that are clearly prohibited by the school/illegal on university orders. My point is, why are we in this position in the first place? No one wants to live in a dorm wher they are constantly in fear of being sent home/moved (not to mention actually getting sick) and unable to have any visitors. Most people don't want to take all their classes online from home. Some people are cool with that, good for them. For the rest of us, they should have just told us to come next year. Think about this--once it became clear that housing cancellations would serve the university (i.e. when they realized massive spread was inevitable and they would need the reduced numbers/additional space for possible isolation rooms) they bent over backwards to make it easy to cancel, no strings attached. They even extended the deadline twice. By contrast, what about the procedure for deferral (something that does not benefit the university no matter how bad the pandemic is, because we will pay the same tuition even if 100% of people were at home)? No changes, not broadly advertised, not even clear what the standards for acceptance were. And the deadline passed (with no extension) just as it was beginning to become clear how bad things were getting in NC/the country in July. Look, I know you can learn in online classes. I know we have another three years of college left. I also know that I have absolutely zero enthusiasm or excitement about being a college student right now and I do not appreciate being forced into this position. Had I had the option of deferring once the university began to admit that ""the on campus experience will be very different this year"" (code for we have been misleading you all along), I would have done so in a heartbeat. I really resent the way that this university has been treating freshman in particular this year.",2020-08-14 16:13:22,23

post,UNC Ends Black Student Movement’s 52-year ‘co-ownership’ of Upendo Lounge,"UNC Ends Black Student Movement’s 52-year ‘co-ownership’ of Upendo Lounge On Friday afternoon, the UNC Black Student Movement held a press conference announcing that the organization's ""co-ownership"" of the Upendo Lounge in the North Student and Academic Services Building had been dissolved. According to BSM President Adam Sherif, University administrators cited new federal guidelines, arguing that identity-based spaces like the lounge, which has historically been a gathering space for Black students, ""facially discourage students of other races from accessing the space"" and ""may foster a hostile environment."" The lounge has been in the ""co-ownership"" of UNC BSM since 1973 and has served as a community space for Black students to ""gather to study, read, relax and socialize in a predominantly Black atmosphere,"" according to a statement from the BSM Instagram account.

comment,UNC Ends Black Student Movement’s 52-year ‘co-ownership’ of Upendo Lounge,"So it's not that it was a space *for* Black students, it was a business that everyone was allowed to use and that for reasons possibly but not entirely related to the co-ownership a lot of Black students liked to go there? And someone says that made non-BIPOC students feel disallowed and so the option was to dissolve the co-ownership to, what, make Black students less likely to show up? Is the state going to shut down all of NCCU because it's historically been a gathering place for Black students? I *get* that it's a politically fraught landscape for public universities right now, but *fuck* I've never seen an entity *so proactively* get down on the ground to start licking boots *no one even asked to have licked* like UNC.

comment,UNC Ends Black Student Movement’s 52-year ‘co-ownership’ of Upendo Lounge,"Here’s a somewhat contrary opinion for your consideration. I graduated in 1980, and again in 1986. I’m white. I never went to the Upendo Lounge, because, why would I? It wasn’t for me. I’m trying to think of what probably happened in the lounge — what did I miss? — and I have only the vaguest idea: Guest speakers? Parties? Soul music?

comment,UNC Ends Black Student Movement’s 52-year ‘co-ownership’ of Upendo Lounge,">Is this a coincidence? Or was the Upendo Lounge a kind of separate-but-equal that our society is trying to outgrow? When you leave it to ""default mode"", inevitably the people who get centered is the majority. Spaces like this exist to help center someone who isn't the majority. This wouldn't be a problem if the history of relations between the majority and the minority groups wasn't so fraught as it is in NC. After all, when you live in a state where Confederate flags fly and are still displayed casually, black and brown people have no reason to feel ""safe"" by not fighting for spaces in which they are prioritized. >I’m not saying that change should come about in this way. The best would be if visits to the lounge declined organically because there was no longer a need for a safe space to gather. This would be nice too but given the fact that one is never more than a few minutes from a Confederate flag being flown casually, we are still very far from the need of a safe space to gather. Just because racial slurs aren't being thrown around as casually as they were without repercussion doesn't mean things are ""better."" We're a short step away from going back.",2025-10-13 18:19:33,6
comment,UNC Ends Black Student Movement’s 52-year ‘co-ownership’ of Upendo Lounge,"> The best would be if visits to the lounge declined organically because there was no longer a need for a safe space to gather Well that's obviously not true right now you ding dong, take a look around. Silent Sam was in his place of honor on McCorkle Place right along Franklin until 2018 and only removed because the students and community forcibly took it down. Read Julian Carr's dedication speech for the statue and tell me you'd feel 100% completely safe on as a black student on a campus with that symbol displayed front and center. Shit one time I saw frat bros yelling the n-word out of their car at random black people on the street when I was an undergrad and that was in the late 2000s. The rest of the point you're making is the exact same argument racist white students made against its existence when it was established in the early 70s. The fact that you were an undergrad in the 70s and are acting like race wasn't an issue (or worse that it was the Black Student Movement's fault, lmao) just makes you sound disingenuous, and even if you're just being contrarian you're still devil's advocating on behalf of racist talking points. Not to mention evidently coming from a place of total and complete (perhaps willful) ignorance about the racial climate in 2025. Also quite frankly nothing material prevented you from actually going there so if you feel like you missed out on some integral part of your time at UNC in the 70s/80s because ""it wasn't for you"" that's on you. You think white students never set foot in there for 50 years? Give me a break. [Less than 8%](https://oira.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/297/2024/06/fb1986_1987.pdf) of the student body was black in 1986 and 87% was white. In the 70s when you were an undergrad it was even more racially homogeneous. Maybe the reason you don't remember chatting with black people is because you didn't bother seeking out those conversations or friendships.",2025-10-16 15:26:24,1

post,On a more grateful note,"On a more grateful note I wasn't on campus very long today, still noticed the somber mood, the lack of usual frivolity, the three chairs at the pit strewn with bouquets of flowers. But I also saw your pumpkin puppies, your banners from fraternity roofs, your willingness to address a stranger as one would address a dear friend in times of crisis. Speaking to you, Gen Z: it is obvious to me as an observer just how much you all love each other. I'm just far enough away from being a young 20-something to feel removed and curious. And I'm close enough to see that there is something truly special about you all. You do better appreciating each other in your differences than my generation ever has. You make sure when you can that everyone gets heard. Feels seen. The kindness you feel in your hearts, put it on display every day as you did today. Believe the best about each other. If one person tells jokes and another picks up a sign and another writes a scathing op-ed and another gives out cookies, awesome. All of this is needed. Such differences are part of being a diverse population, and no solution to our mental health crisis will be THE solution unless it reflects the diversity in our minds. I'll say it again: believe the best about each other.",2021-10-11 20:16:56,191

post,very sad first year,"very sad first year i moved in august 3rd. it’s only been 2 weeks but i’ve already made such a connection with my suite (we have a full 8, found each other on facebook) and i didn’t think it would hurt this much. i was fully expecting to be sent home which eased my nerves of coming here. what i didn’t anticipate was actually loving living here so much and saying i didn’t want to go home before we even found out about this. i thought i’d move out and be glad to be home but instead somehow i’m going to seriously miss these girls i met just 2 weeks ago. i wish we could leave our stuff and keep the rooms for the spring, i hate that we have to reapply and probably won’t get “our” same rooms back. i didn’t believe everyone who said how amazing college was because i thought it was just harder school...well, thank you, carolina. you’ve really made an impression on me these two weeks. i hope i see y’all in the spring. i just hope people aren’t stupid enough to party again.",2020-08-18 11:48:17,189
comment,very sad first year,really hurts my heart for all the first year students who just met the people who would become some of their best friends. it’s okay to appreciate the gravity of the situation and still be sad about leaving the girls you’ve already grown with in some ways. just try to stay in touch and maybe you can find a way to live together next semester or even next year! sending love and good vibes your way.,2020-08-18 12:33:04,37
comment,very sad first year,"The rational person / adult says this is best for your health and safer - but remembering my first semester of college - I learned so much from others living in the dorm and I really hate for you to miss out on that stuff, plus the whole friendship thing that helped with classes, exam anxiety etc.",2020-08-18 12:29:38,31
comment,very sad first year,"So if you cancel your contract now you have to reapply, but if you wait until either the semester ends or we get kicked out then you don’t? Meaning that if you choose to leave now you have to basically start all over in the spring, but if you choose to stay, then you can keep current arrangements? How does this work for Carolina Away?",2020-08-18 12:51:53,15
comment,very sad first year,"I’m a freshman and I decided to go fully online (not in UNC though). I felt terrible when it had to cancel housing cause I was really getting along with my roommate already 😔this was gonna happen eventually and we all knew that.

The stress and anxiety the university has weighed on you is inexcusable. As an alumni I’m ashamed of the administration’s lack of care for you all. Stay in touch with those friends and suite mates. When you all eventually can make a safe return to campus, these difficulties will make y’all even closer! On another note, I am in grad school to become a counselor. If you or any of your friends ever need someone to talk to, I’m sure some of my licensed friends would be glad to help you all through this virtually.

comment,very sad first year,"Man, I'm really sorry this had to happen during your fist year. Believe me, as a student I'm just as pissed as the next guy at the whole situation. The way the administration has handled things and how a large portion of students have been acting is not befitting of a school of UNC's reputation. To work incredibly hard to get into UNC and then have to deal with this must be the absolute worst feeling. I really hope things turn out well for your second semester. Hopefully the administration can figure out what their priorities should be and start turning things around. Best of luck to you and all the other students with online classes. It's an adjustment, but we'll get through it.",2020-08-18 21:18:47,5
comment,very sad first year,This is a difficult time for many of us and I am very sorry you're feeling that way. It sucks that you were able to build strong connections with people you've just met and now you already have to say goodbye for now.

comment,very sad first year,"I do agree, I didn’t want to say this because it might sting more. But I was thinking about how the reason my first year was so great is because I was such a sponge!! I was so open and ready to learn, just like every other freshman around me. Something has been taken from you and it’ll make you guys want it that much more, so when you are able to safely come back, it is going to be a truly transformational experience.

comment,ACCEPTED INTO MY TOP CHOICE!!!,"Congrats! The graduation rate for UNC is pretty good, so if you got in the odds of you bombing aren't high. Don't let the imposter syndrome make you think you don't deserve to be here! If you come in with any credits, I recommend a lower class load for your first semester. Sign up for max classes and then drop the worst one after you meet the profs. You're gonna want as much time as possible to explore, meet to people, and try new things first semester. I think the hardest things is learning how to take care of yourself and manage your time. Unless you're natural born early-riser, avoid 8am classes. There's a lot of help available, so if you're struggling reach out early! Don't let the fear of failure stop your dreams <3",2021-01-28 21:53:56,3

And this is true for so many classes, a lot of the anthropology classes are so cool and really open your mind up to make connections between classes you didn’t know could ever connect and is so truly interesting.Taking classes you know the material in already is understandable especially if it’s something you like, and I get it-sometimes gen eds are easier if you already know it but you’re missing out on some really interesting stuff if you do that.",2021-01-29 00:19:05,4

post,Extremely burnt out,"Extremely burnt out Over my past 3 years at UNC, my attitude towards classes has shifted from enthusiasm to apathy, to annoyance, to repulsion. It feels like my brain actively rejects every topic taught in my classes. One look at my transcript and you'll see the exact point where I stopped caring. I can't stand the idea of studying. I'd rather clean my room 10 times than complete an assignment. I'm hoping to graduate in December, so I'm trying to muster all my energy to just... pass my classes. I just want to get my degree and leave. And go far, far away. My fear is that even after graduating, this feeling might seep into my personal life and my career. So how do I start fresh? What should I do right after graduating?",2023-09-17 17:34:04,186

comment,Extremely burnt out,"Hi! I am feeling the exact same thing my guy. I actually took a 1.5 year break because I got so burnt out I started failing all of my classes and couldn’t keep going mentally or emotionally. During that break I was working, and while I didn’t adore my job, I was still happier than I was at UNC as there was no continuous stress from work carrying over every day like there was at UNC. The constant thought of work never being done in my opinion, stays at school. In a job (at least most) your work stays there. You can go home and relax. Here I feel like that doesn’t exist because there is alwayss more work to be done and more stress to be had. Point is, my 1.5 year break of working made me realize this burn out disappears once I got out of here. Now that I’m back I’m burnt out but I can continue because I know it’s almost over and real life is honestly easier than college and less continuous stress. However, I would second a previous comment recommending therapy. I know CAPS has a bad reputation, but it can’t hurt to try it! I recently went back to CAPS for the exact same thing. I definitely think it would help! If you’d like I could go with you or just be a listening ear. My last bit of advice, most students at UNC are overachievers and I know it’s tough to see grades we aren’t used to, but at this point Cs and even Ds get degrees. All that matters is that diploma! So don’t push yourself too hard, all that matters is you graduate. This helped my mindset tremendously! I now think, I can enjoy my semester and do extracurriculars because I don’t have to give 100%! Giving 50% and passing is good enough! I think that helps me with the stress and I hope it can help you too!",2023-09-18 02:32:48,19
comment,Extremely burnt out,"Burnout is real, and how it affects your life after college may be determined in part by the source of the burnout. In general, though, working after college is going to offer more variety to keep your interest. You’ll likely be working with other people to accomplish something beyond a grade, so there’s motivation in other people depending on you. For now, it sounds like working with a therapist would be a really good idea. Maybe consider whether you have ADHD and discuss testing, if appropriate. CAPS works well as a starting point. If you don’t want to continue with CAPS, they can help you find a provider in the community. Like Student Health, CAPS’s strength is in working with relatively straightforward issues. They can’t do long-term therapy, so more complicated or intense issues tend to be beyond the scope of what they do. If you don’t feel like you fit with your therapist, you can tell them that and talk about options for switching or being referred out to a community provider. You can also just find another. If cost is an issue with a community provider, some have a sliding fee scale. CAPS might be able to connect you.",2023-09-18 11:23:22,15
comment,Extremely burnt out,"Sounds like you need more personalized help than reddit can provide. If it's within your means, I highly recommend seeking therapy to delve into what could be making you feel this way and how to prevent this going forward after university. For me, my gridlock midway through college ended up being due to ADHD. Initially, medication was perfect for moving me forward. Now, lifestyle changes have enabled me to thrive without medication. YMMV.",2023-09-17 18:00:01,27
comment,Extremely burnt out,"My burnt out started from my junior year after I went through severe depression. Indeed, I made it out on my own. I escaped from Chinese public education system and went to US for college. But I found that I’m starting to repel the idea of studying, working, anything that is “important” for life. Sounds like as if I only want to live my life and enjoy it without doing any “main” things. That’s actually quite confusing me too…",2023-09-19 01:18:29,8
comment,Extremely burnt out,"I felt this way last semester and almost failed my classes. What helped was going to therapy to work through my issues and extreme text anxiety, and recognizing that it’s okay to do the bare minimum (I’m only taking 12 credits this semester). I’ll graduate later than expected, but I don’t want to go through the hell that was Spring 2023 again.",2023-09-19 10:37:00,4
comment,Extremely burnt out,"I remember this feeling. Life doesn't get any easier. It is best to tackle these thoughts and feelings now and find healthy ways to cope with anxiety, burnout, or whatever it is you are feeling. In this situation, the worst thing you can do is ignore your feelings. I would talk to someone about how you feel while prioritizing your well-being in the meantime. As someone who has a bit of experience, I can tell you that life doesn't get any easier. Yes, working in your career is a change of scene, but you will likely be more prone to burnout in the professional setting. Careers can be mundane, tedious, and repetitive. You don't change classes every semester, nor do you have new classmates and professors every 4 months. No, you tend to have the same coworkers for years and years, depending on the nature of the job. You also have a series of managers that constantly evaluate your output and are subject to quarterly performance reviews. Not only that, folks like a spouse and children will depend on your success and productivity in the workplace. They will also depend on you to play an active role in family life. You will also have bills that'll need to be paid that will amount to several thousands of dollars a month. I don't want to be overly negative, because life is also very beautiful, but I want to inject some realism too! It is simply a fallacy to think life gets easier as you age, so it best to take the time to work on these issues now. School is an absolute cakewalk compared to raising a family and working at a job.",2023-09-21 14:23:42,3
comment,Extremely burnt out,"Hi! I’m the exact same way, and want to say that I’ve worked full time all throughout college and this feeling has *never* seeped over into work. UNC is just particularly hellish and exhausting for me. Which is just to say fear not- aim to find a job you’re passionate about, in an environment/culture you thrive in. I’m so sorry your experience at UNC has been shitty- mine has too. It’s way more common than people think (bc everyone only posts about basketball and drinking and how great UNC is). I’ve been seeing a therapist and wellness coach and psychiatrist for years to help with my feelings, and I recommend developing your own mental health support network. But to answer your question on how to start fresh…. What excites you? What thought makes your brain light up and makes the corner of your lips turn up when you think of it? You mentioned going far far away.. do that! Forget UNC. Forget how awful it’s felt. Get through this last bit, slack off, do the bare minimum, get your fucking paper and never look back. You got this. And after a short few months, you never have to step foot in this god forsaken campus again. You’re going to be okay. Better than okay, I hope! And you may find like me that you don’t feel this way at all about work",2023-09-27 15:14:56,2

comment,Extremely burnt out,"Just want to add that what you are describing sounds very similar to the depressive episode I experienced last semester. For me it was like an intense block that almost seemed physical that made it near impossible for me to motivate to do anything productive. This was a wakeup call for me that led me to finally see a therapist to deal with the depression I had for years (I never had an episode that strong before and was always able to “fake it til you make it” to get through it in the past).

I eventually (around 30) got serious about going to therapy and finding a medicine that would help after losing a friend to suicide and having my own suicidal thoughts.

We have fine examples of those in China, NK, Russia etc. I'm not opposed to the idea that a society has to take care of itself as a whole, as an entity together. But, you need to have personal responsibility, accountability in place. How do we define that entity? Is it our responsibility to supply covid vaccine to the rest of the world? And why is that? We didn't cause this. Why WHO doesn't ask China to provide that. You know how much China provides in WHO funding? 1/10 of what US provides. Yet they control its operations.

comment,"Bigot comes to campus to scream about god, students respond with dancing.","My personal views don’t have to guide everyone for us to definitively say that some views are wrong. And it’s not the fact that I disagree with them that makes them wrong, it’s their disagreement with objective morality. There are people who think black people are inherently inferior to whites and they don’t deserve to have their views respected, amplified, legitimized etc. Socialism is a theory about how the framework of a society should be organized. Other examples are fascism, conservatism, liberalism, and communism (among other in between). Authoritarianism is how the governing group goes about installing that framework. Another example is democracy. I’m not sure if you’re trying to say that Russia is authoritarian and socialist, but that would be very incorrect. Authoritarian absolutely, but definitely capitalist. I also don’t understand what any of this has to do with the WHO? And not being responsible for your actions? All I’m saying is that being a “free thinker” doesn’t mean you have to be contrarian all the time or that you have to assign equal value to everyone’s views. Objective morality doesn’t come from some central governing authority. We don’t need others to tell us that racism and fascism are bad and their supports are bad people.

You kinda have to treat it like a communal or hall style bathroom and mind your own business. It’s better though bc you usually befriend your suitemates so it’s not like randoms are in there, I loved talking to my suitemates if they came in while I was showering lol.",2024-06-10 16:03:28,8

post,I finally figured out why zoom classes are so exhausting,"I finally figured out why zoom classes are so exhausting Instead of sitting quietly with either your back to the room or looking forward at everyone else’s backs, you’re sitting at the front of the class, facing the class, staring everyone head on...for two or more hours. 💀",2020-08-19 21:41:23,182

comment,I finally figured out why zoom classes are so exhausting,"For those exhausted by zoom, consider doing something like easy knitting, crochet, hand sewing, or another mindless handcraft during class. It helps disengage from looking at people all the time while still paying attention. I started doing this over summer when in large-group meetings or lectures. It substantially improved my zoom experience and my mood. It's a good idea to give your professor or TA a heads-up so they know that's what listening looks like for you.",2020-08-20 00:10:33,52

comment,I finally figured out why zoom classes are so exhausting,"Yes. There's an article on this, but I don't recall where. If you're watching the speaker, you're really only able to see their face and can't visually ""take a break"" as easily like you can do by looking at the whiteboards, clock, people on Facebook in front of you, etc. Reading the presenter's body language is harder, and there's little sense of how others are reacting. On another hand, this may be an interesting window for students to see what it looks like from the front of the room during lecture. Learning doesn't necessarily look like people sitting up and looking at the presenter, but it often can seem that way from the front of the room.",2020-08-19 22:58:27,23

comment,I finally figured out why zoom classes are so exhausting,I feel this. There's a good accessibility argument for people being able to turn off their camera as needed. We're all in different home situations now. Some of us need to just get up and move around for our own ability to focus. Others may have to watch younger siblings while in class. Having it on can help feel like you're part of the discussion more for your classmates. If you can keep it on sometimes and set it so that you're not looking at yourself it might help. Ask your professor if you can sometimes keep your camera off because it would help you focus.,2020-08-20 13:20:00,1

comment,Spartan here sending love❤️,"Wahoos stand in solidarity too. This has happened way too often. While thoughts and prayers aren’t really going to cut it, it’s all we can give as individuals (for now, at least). The media advice is huge — you will inevitably have someone try to take advantage of their proximity to chase clout, so please don’t let it be you. It’s kinda shocking how much we got hounded, hope the same doesn’t happen to y’all but I have a sinking feeling it will. Stay strong. Also, absolutely take up the schools resources. Even if you don’t feel affected now, people around you will slowly begin to feel it and suddenly you will too. Take time to process what happened, though it’s valid to feel like you want to focus on your studies and just block it out. People process differently, just how it is. You’re not broken for processing differently than the others around you.",2023-08-29 00:10:44,6

comment,Is anyone else ready to move on?,"Staff member here so a bit of a different viewpoint. For us they have explicitly sent info telling us that we can come work in our offices if we want, so we have a bit more of a choice in how “normal” we want our routines to be. The condition 3 allows people who need more time to adjust the ability to take time off without being penalized - and it is to be expected an above average number of people would need time to adjust. Unfortunately group activities like class are an all or nothing thing. You can’t just have class for people who want to be there. I went into the office today because I needed a change of scenery. Hell, I wanted to go to the office more than I normally do this morning lol. No one else in my group is here but they are all still working just at home. It’s different for us all. It’s also worth noting that some of this may also be for ease of investigators to get where they need to be without worrying about tons of people on campus.",2023-08-30 15:29:18,33

comment,Is anyone else ready to move on?,"I totally understand this sentiment and it’s very valid. I’m glad it had given you a sense of reassurance in going back to the classroom. Just so you and others reading this know - seeing students and parents express this over and over online has not helped my readiness to go back to the classroom. I’m not saying you shouldn’t feel that way or express it. Some of the people making this point (not you per se!) have done so in pretty jarring ways that callously imply there wasn’t really danger here, so we can get back to things already. For some of us faculty, targeted shooting is as much a reoccurring nightmare as a random mass shooting. And, many of us have had scary encounters with students before that make this feel very close to home. So many of my conversations in the last days have been with my colleagues talking about “close calls”, where we have felt unsafe at work from various student encounters. Again, your perspective is totally valid. I just wanted to put out there - some of us faculty have also really needed the time to pull ourselves together before showing back up to work.",2023-08-30 21:55:58,21

comment,Is anyone else ready to move on?,"I 100% understand this. As a faculty member, I would actually be more worried about targeted shooting than mass, where it’s completely random. My feeling was more that I, individually, was never technically in danger because of this shooter’s intent. It was traumatic and the worst experience of my life, but it’s been SLIGHTLY easier to cope in the aftermath by rationalizing it that way. With respect to the future…as a faculty member I’d probably be more shook than had it been random. Every time you don’t award a student with what they feel they’ve earned, every time you need to do your job and evaluate students with integrity….you risk upsetting the wrong student. 99.9% of us internalize that and maybe blame the faculty member in some instances as a crutch.

comment,Who's with me?,"Well. UNC is attempting to stop people from visiting each other's dorms, which is impossible and weird since people will hang out with or without the dorm regardless. This has made it even harder to meet people, so everyone is kind of struggling with that (freshmen, because they're new, and upperclassmen because friends may have stayed home). Dining halls limit seating to one or two people at a table, but everyone just adjusts chairs so they sit close with friends regardless or they eat in groups 10 feet outside the dining hall. And no social functions of the campus are running (clubs are struggling I think, convocation was online, libraries are limited). This is all to be expected of course and for safety reasons, but it results anyway in a bizarrely lonely (compared to last year) campus despite it being fairly packed. It's all for a good reason, but yeah, not the Carolina we loved. Feel terrible for the freshmen :(",2020-08-11 15:55:12,6

comment,UNC pulling us back in Fall for revenue be like,"I don't disagree that some measure of activity has to resume. The university is in a tough position right now and sustaining operations takes a hell of a lot more than just our tuition, so bringing people back is advantageous to them. We do want a university to go back to when the pandemic is over. What numbers we can't see right now are the long-term effects of contracting coronavirus on younger populations. Literally the only person I know who has had COVID-19 is younger and has no preexisting conditions. However, the damage to his heart and lungs is so severe that before he left the hospital, doctors gave him a life expectancy of about ten years from here out. Not only is he anticipated to die young, but he has been told that he cannot go back to the work he was doing because the stress will easily trigger another heart attack and kill him. Now, throw a bunch of stressed out students running on minimal sleep into a cess pool and, while the situation I know is anecdotal, I do think we'll see similar situations. The immediate death rates by age group now is not going to be the real death rate. We're asking people to risk their lives now, *and* be okay with the possible long term effects of that illness on their well-being, happiness, career and physical health. And we should take this seriously. I personally suffered an infection at 19 that gave me lifelong chronic illness, cut my college education short at the time, and kept me from working a full time job. That, too, is an economic impact. I hope UNC can find a way to keep people on campus who want to be on campus, socially distanced, and enable people who say, ""Nope, not worth it,"" when considering their loved ones or personal circumstances to continue their studies online or take a year off if needed. I hope we all pull through this in the end.",2020-05-22 16:13:35,6

If students had no say in the colleges local elections then the primary driver of the local economy would be beholden to small group of locals who have no interest in the students well being and only their relation/exploitation to the school. Additionally being able to vote locally is how you start to become aware of local issues. Most student will never move back to wherever “they are from” and will continue moving around the country influencing elections wherever with the lessons the learned from those previous communities. Locals fight this argument in every college town big enough to influence elections which is funny being that those towns are notorious for relying on the said problem for most of their economy and identity. It’s doubly funny that most of their “locals” ended up being locals because their family has graduates that stayed after finding a community there.,2024-10-31 12:30:41,5

post,Thx,"Thx Hey y’all. Thx for being my classmates and my family. I was locked down with new classmates for those several hours, and I love every one of you that was with me. None of us said a word at first, outside of the stuff to lock down the class and decide where we should hide/crouch. The fact one of you experienced this threat in HS was chilling. Then, as we followed the situation and the immediate threat seemed to dissipate by the minute….we began to chat. We talked about our hometowns, our studies, our friends. We didn’t talk about our social lives- that didn’t seem important. We talked about what we loved at UNC. We made a pact that we’d grab a lunch before a class at least once a month. All of us. I hope that happens. Yesterday sucked. It will always be 99% bad, and the lost life is irreplaceable. But I have new connections and friends who I hope will become more. I’m not going to name the class, but you guys know who you are. I don’t know you but I love you for making that small space feel comfortable in the midst of hell.",2023-08-29 18:19:20,172

comment,Roberts Named Permanent Chancellor,"As a (former) faculty member, I am not thrilled that they appointed a chancellor with no academic experience, especially when the appointment seems to be partly (entirely?) due to partisan politics. But let's also keep this in perspective. The provost is the one who is in charge of the academic side of the university. Roberts' influence in that area is generally very limited. Far and away the most important job of the chancellor (or any university president) is to raise money. I don't think it is totally crazy to hire a finance guy with experience raising money for higher education for a job that is largely a glorified fundraising position. It's also less likely that the Republicans in the legislature will try to micromanage the university if they feel like ""their guy"" is leading it. So while I don't love this hire, I don't think it is necessarily catastrophic, either. If he proves to be a successful fundraiser, this could actually turn out to be a good hire.",2024-08-10 03:59:39,34

post,My journey with UNC comes to an end,"My journey with UNC comes to an end A little over two years ago, I went to visit a friend at UNC. At the time, I was working rotating shifts at a factory near my hometown. I was a mediocre high school student and had a crappy first go at college. That weekend at UNC awoke something in me. I fell in love. I was in love with the campus, with the people, with the history - all of it. That weekend inspired me to go back to CC, which I did. Two years later, I’m still working at that factory, but I’ll be graduating from CC in May. In my off time, I wrote for the student newspaper and was a docent at our local history museum. I got close to my professors and to the museum curators. I was a full time student with a full time job and I was thriving. All of that was to help me get into Carolina. I wrote and re-wrote essays, got strong recommendations, and worked hard to nurse my academic record from the damage I’d done earlier in life. At 23 years old, I applied to transfer to UNC. Today, I got rejected. Some might that funny, others might find that sad. Me, I’m focusing on the will power I discovered in myself. I’ve grown so much, and even though it’s not ending where I’d hoped, I’m still so grateful. I’m not sure why I’m writing this. Maybe I just need to get it out. Regardless, I want to congratulate all the people accepted today! Your hard work has paid off and you deserve this! Enjoy your time there, and good luck.

comment,My journey with UNC comes to an end,"I know this will sound like a million platitudes you've probably heard or expect to hear, but you're still young. Personally, I *fucked up* my first *and* second go at college. Only finished my actual undergrad degree around the age of 27. It wasn't UNC, it was a podunk state university in the intermountain west. But I got into UNC, my top choice grad school, without issue. Don't look at this as a disappointment and an end. Carolina is one of many fantastic schools; you can undoubtedly get into many of them and do well. You could go to one and transfer to Carolina after a year, perhaps. Or, if your career aspirations dictate, you could do as I did and start at Carolina as a graduate student. And who knows? Maybe you'll get through a year or two at another school and realize Carolina is just buildings and classes and students, and you can find those wherever you end up, too. Please don't think this is the end. Life is full of ""ends"", but they're actually pivot points.

Even though my CTOPS advisor told me not to. I went back and aced through a summer and fall and just decided it wasnt for me and ended up graduating from ECU at 30.

post,Today I graduated…,"Today I graduated… Today I graduated. This semester I wanted so badly to be another chair in the pit. I felt more isolated than I ever have. I listened as my therapist walked me through the steps on how to check myself into the hospital. I wanted to give up on everything and disappear. But today I graduated. My freshman year I had a GPA in the 2.0s, and I hated every day because I felt like I needed to major in stem to be smart, to have a good future. Today I graduated with a humanities degree, in a subject I’m passionate about, with distinction. Today I graduated with an offer from my dream grad school and a renewed love for the subject. Today I graduated. My time at unc was rocky and not at all linear. It’s been a rough couple of years, especially with the pandemic, and I know there are many who feel like they’re drowning. I urge you to find what you love, pursue it, and keep going. I promise you it does get better. Because today I graduated.",2021-12-12 17:43:01,174

post,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective I know this might be an unpopular opinion... I've noticed a lot of people posting with complaints about the pass/fail. I teach at UNC (made a throwaway for obvious reasons). The pass/fail option was unfortunately not made for the students who are being most vocal about it. Before the deadline to declare, I heard almost exclusively from students who were on track to receive B+'s or A-'s as to whether they should pass/fail. Unfortunately, I did not feel qualified to give that advice. It's very much each student's decision. An A- is an amazing grade, but somehow I guess these students managed to do amazing in every single course at UNC and an A- would bring down their GPA. The thing is, they're not not who the pass/fail option was intended to help. I also had many students with extreme personal circumstances, and these students seriously underperformed given those circumstances. They would've had trouble even passing the class if I did not grade rather generously he entire semester. The pass/fail and my grading policy was for them. To return to those vocal students who emailed me...the thing they don't realize is that my generous grading benefitted them. I did not selectively generously grade. Everyone benefitted from it. Those students would've likely had lower grades than the ones they're disputing. Now to be clear, I graded the same across the board not only because I have to, but also because I know all students likely faced some sort of struggles because of COVID. I just want to bring attention to the fact that pass/fail wasn't created to be some kind of grading loophole GPA saver for A+ students who were at risk of making their first A-. It was made for those students who likely were doing poorly in multiple courses and would've absolutely plummeted their GPA were it not for pass/fail. Also, be nice to your professors. Every teacher I know had to find creative ways to make sure the students at the bottom quarter or half of their course even passed. It often meant a lot more work for us. This work had to be completed when many of us were facing our own crises. I had two relatives die from COVID and many others get sick. However, I'd do all that work again in order to not fail more students in a single term than my entire time teaching at UNC (edit: which seemed likely midway through the course, but it did not happen). You can be mad at UNC, but pass/fail really saved some students. That's all. I typed this on a phone, so please excuse any errors. Edit: Thank you all for the discussion. One more thing I'd like to say is that your reviews matter more than you may know, whether that's evals or websites like ratemyprof. If you have amazing and generous professors, writing kind reviews on their behalf is a meaningful way to repay them.",2020-12-01 17:00:17,166
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"I personally blame no professors for UNC's difficulties or any pass/fail struggles. I do feel that the UNC administration is much less focused on students than its professors. All of my professors were amazing and understanding, both this semester and last. Thank you so much for your help and hard work!",2020-12-01 17:38:45,17
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"Thank you for your perspective. I agree. This isn’t for someone looking to keep a 4.0 from becoming a 3.87 - it’s to keep a 3.0 from not graduating. Shockingly, professors are humans too. They’re struggling just as much as students are - and sometimes more by carrying a family through some pretty biblical stuff. Also, professors aren’t the administration. They’re not the board of governors. All of my profs have done a hell of a job quickly adapting while serving in institutions not known for changing or adapting at all.",2020-12-01 18:24:18,33
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"I really appreciate how passionate you are about your profession. It's very clear from this post that you are an empathetic and compassionate professor. I literally would have dropped out this semester if it were not for professors like you. I think that a lot of the anger students are feeling is directed at the UNC administration - it is for me, anyway. I'm upset over things I know you had no control over, like bringing students back when OCHD literally begged UNC in a public statement not to do so; but again, that's not on professors. I really hope you're not taking the anger personally. I know that it must be hard not to, so I'm telling you as a student that I was impressed by my professors this semester. They were exceedingly understanding. Sometimes I scroll through r/professors and I'm floored by the total disregard by some students for the fact that professors are human. Some of the emails I've seen quoted there are just awful. Please know that the vast majority of students don't claim them and we see you.",2020-12-01 20:36:34,14
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"Thanks for your compassion and for your perspective. I definitely think you're on the money with pinpointing who the students are who were most upset by p/f. I almost used it to p/f a class I thought I'd make an -A in. While I did have multiple health crises and a family health situation that caused me to do worse in my classes, I was never at the point where I was going to fail. I do wish that professors posted grades on Sakai (multiple of mine did not post grades in the grade book) and were more transparent about grades. But, I came to the conclusion that an -A would be better on my transcript than a P (I'm thinking about going to grad school) and chose to take the risk. A lot of students have struggled with mental health issues and online classes, so using p/f to try to maintain their high GPAs helped them feel better about this difficult, out of control semester. I'm glad that the option was available for as long as it was, but we should all be thankful we had the option even if it wasn't perfect.",2020-12-02 00:05:08,12

comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"Most the complaints I heard were about teachers not putting grades in, in time for the decision to be made about whether to take it pass/fail.

comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"As a student with extreme personal circumstances (dad passed away from Covid before semester started and I was the one dealing with legal stuff and housing situations) who pass/failed 3 out of 4 of my classes and got an A- in one of those (RIP), I agree with your perspective. On the other hand, a lot of my professors actually said that they were advocating for the pass/fail option to be the same as it was last year (for students to be able to decide after seeing their grade). It was especially difficult for me to decide whether or not to pass/fail since the main thing I was having trouble with was getting things in on time, so I had no clue what my grades were or how my professors were going to grade my (very) late assignments. Ultimately I’m just super grateful we had the option to pass/fail - friends of mine who go to school at IU (Indiana) and Boston University did not have that option, and I think us UNC students are just spoiled by the very generous policy from last semester! Even though the A- I got in one of my P/F classes would have brought my GPA up, I knew that getting a higher grade was an option and I made a judgment call. So I don’t want to take it back or fight the registrar’s office for it at all 🤷🏻‍♀️. Thank you for your perspective!",2020-12-01 21:12:54,7

That's not to say it couldn't have been executed better, but it is somewhat exhausting to meet mostly with A or A- students who pass/failed or A- students who passed but didn't get the A they wanted. Edit: also, I completely agree about bringing students back! How ridiculous! Unfortunately, I know many students actually wanted to come back.

comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"Good luck with your grad school applications!! Get to know an established professor or two that you look up to. Their letter's of Rec will be invaluable. This semester convinced me to always be transparent and use the Sakai grade book. I want students to always know how they're doing. It also helped me to see in one place who was not keeping up in the course, which in turn led me to reaching out to them to strategize ways to catch up--something else more profs should do. Just so you all know, the Sakai grade book has surprising functionality. It's much better than excel spreadsheets.

comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"I wanted to second what the above poster said! The professors at UNC are amazing----I was a transfer student and I know a lot of students say they prefer their CC experience, but actually I prefer my UNC professors over any other institution I've been in. It's basically admin that gets in the way, not the professors (who are doing the best they possibly can). A big example is the difference between UNC and NCSU. Honestly NC State is a bit more transfer-friendly because of certain policies they have (grade exclusion--you can kill two grades from your GPA calculation)----I have one bad grade from my first semester at UNC because of some medical issues and an issue with getting an accommodation (admin lost my documents). I basically have no hope of recovering it because I only have so much time left at UNC, but it would be a non-issue at state. Or NCSU allowed a different P/F policy that was more similar to the previous semester, for example. For what it's worth I also heard that NCSU treats its graduate students a little bit better overall (taken from someone I know who is a UNC undergrad turned State grad student). Certainly no fault of the professors, and absolutely not the fault of the TAs and grad students who I feel like routinely get railed by...everybody.",2020-12-01 23:34:35,2
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"Thank you for the advice! I have a mentor at my former college who has been invaluable (and ultimately helped me get into UNC), but I have yet to make those connections at UNC since I'm a transfer. The pandemic has made it much harder to get to know people, but I will keep your advice in mind. Yes, using the grade book feature seems like an ideal option for everyone involved. It was super helpful for me to go over and make sure I hadn't missed something and calculate grades which reduced a lot of anxiety for me. Multiple students in my classes asked our profs to use them and they said it was ""easier"" for them to just keep their own notes of our grades. They said to calculate the grade based on what they'd returned to us, but that wasn't a complete picture and it was more tedious/stressful. I don't know how to broach the subject with instructors. I thought everyone used the grade book, but I guess not? Do you have any recommendations for how to gently ask instructors to do this? I want to create less stress for everyone, but it can be hard to say this when some instructors seem pretty set in their own ways. Thank you for the response!",2020-12-02 00:20:41,3
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"I can't speak for everyone, but I had multiple professors have participation/professionalism grades that they would not give back until the end of the semester. So, I tried to ask how I was doing on those things and some professors wouldn't give me an explanation or would just say not to worry about it. As a student with an anxiety disorder who had a really rough semester, it was hard for me to know what they meant, especially when some professors were very dismissive of students who were concerned about their grades. So, in my experience, I could only guess a ballpark for grades but wasn't actually sure what I would make. I also had multiple instructors who did not post assignments in the grade book on Sakai which made it extremely difficult to know what grades were as well.",2020-12-01 23:40:31,0
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,">Were you not able to calculate your grade based on the syllabus and returned work? Ha, okay so this one gets more complicated because of some subjects (especially the MATH and STOR departments) that routinely need to curve classes and are heavily weighted on exams---and if the exams aren't graded (one class I know of, some students didn't get their midterm grades back until /after/ they took the final), you're kind of left swinging in the wind. This can be both good and bad, but is definitely not very friendly with the current P/F policy because of the unpredictability of grades within the subject. For example, I got covid and had to miss several weeks of homework in a certain class (and my professor is a god and the love of my life, and deserves to be protected) so the plan was that either the final exam would replace my missing homeworks ---but my professor said to follow up in case the final didn't turn out so hot, because he didn't want me working at a disadvantage simply for getting corona; it was a challenging class even for students who were not sick! It ended up working out way better than expected---I was able to get an A- basically because of a spicy curve on the final, and then he replaced my homework grades automatically since I beat the curve by some magic (studying) and immediately put it in, no issue. I'm so glad I didn't P/F that class, because of the two classes I kept I thought that would be the one that would be my killer. Re: syllabi, I also feel like it's almost really hard to modify syllabuses for flexibility in some subjects (like math or stats) so I feel for the professors there too. With that being said the STOR department in particular I found to be really creative, helpful, and accommodating to extenuating circumstances (such as mine).",2020-12-01 23:40:34,0
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"To be honest, the TA's are the ones to go to. If you can make the case to them, then it'll likely happen. I'm not sure of the best practice to approach the subject, though. If your prof is a nicer and younger sort, then I'm sure they'll be responsive if multiple students request seeing their grades on Sakai. It's mostly my older colleagues who have an aversion to it because they don't want to learn new software and because they like to have ten non-transparent points to play with to boost very active students grades (or to deduct from problem students). After this term, I'm also thinking about doing away with participation points, because they're inherently less transparent than finding some sort of simpler completion assignment to account for ten percent. However, I do worry if that'll reduce the number of active students. Any thoughts?",2020-12-02 00:28:37,2
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"I think participation points definitely increase the number of active students. In one of my classes, everyone started at 8/10 points for participation, and then if you were very active in class you could gain more points. In the end, the TA offered +.75 if you turned on your camera for the last recitation. I think this model is good because 8/10 is still a good mark, but if students want to they can work up to 10/10. If there were no participation points, I know many students would just keep the camera turned off and not participate as much.",2020-12-02 02:21:14,2
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"I have yet to be in any classes with TAs, but I will definitely keep this in mind if I do have one! Yes, I had this issue with an older prof who was very set in her ways. I got to a point of burn out this semester where I just felt like it wasn't worth asking instructors because I was worried about creating bad blood near the end. I understand wanting to have those 10 points to play around with though. I made a higher grade because I got extra points for my participation which I really appreciate. That's a tough question. I do think that doing away with a participation grade will reduce student engagement; however, it can be harder to participate via Zoom because of connectivity issues, talking over people, etc... How do you grade participation? You could do in-class discussions, or you could look into doing something like weekly/in-class forum posts. One of my professors had us do group activities for one whole class period every few weeks. We'd answer questions as a group based on the readings. Something like this could be a good way to get students to talk and work together while giving them something more tangible than just speaking up more in class. I also like forum posts because they can be done before class and give people things to talk about in-class (if that works for the type of course you're teaching).",2020-12-02 02:51:53,1
comment,Pass/fail from a teacher's perspective,"One of my professors mentioned that their department (mejo) launched a large study to examine ""participation in zoom."" I filled out the study survey. From the questions, I am guessing that their hypothesis might be related to zoom anxiety. Keeping your camera on in class is difficult for many students who might feel judged or watched in an uncomfortable/unsettling way. Similarly, answering questions in class via zoom might seem more daunting given the unusual zoomed in focused attention. Some of my professors used written forum posts. Others issued very easy weekly quizzes to track engagement. Still others utilized the chat boxes and had TA's monitor the chat engagement.",2020-12-02 08:44:49,1

comment,This is just disrespectful.,"This move is more about covering their asses for the future. This addendum doesn’t mean that their will be no refunds, or that the University will definitely kick you out if their is a pandemic. They will most likely handle it on a case-by-case basis, just like they did in the Spring. What the addendum does is cover them from a legal standpoint, which is a smart thing to do to avoid headaches (for them) in the future. In the Spring, there wasn’t that much of an uproar yet, and the UNC System went ahead and announced that there would be refunds. I imagine getting partial refunds won’t be a problem if we have to leave early in the Fall either. But I would recommend against not paying: that generally causes more problems than it solves.",2020-06-23 10:09:27,15

comment,This is just disrespectful.,"This is a bit different from all contracts having an ""act of god"" clause. They need to be explicit about COVID-19 because it won't qualify as force majeure since the pandemic will have been going on for months by the time the Fall semester begins. Force majeure arguments weren't working even in March and April, so I doubt they'll hold water for campus housing in a few months.",2020-06-23 19:19:56,2

I’ve already had about 4 or so incidents so far, but today definitely took the cake. I was riding the J back home when this scrawny, old, drug addict looking guy repeatedly threatened to kill me, and even did a little punch bluff to see if I’d flinch. I didn’t really feel that threatened- the guy looked like he was half in the bag and on his way out from this world- but I was all too aware that he may have been armed.

Doing nothing but “sympathizing” actually allows our elected officials to continue to ignore the problem and do nothing to actually address these issues. That does not help the people who need help. Stop sympathizing and tolerating unstable, aggressive behavior and harassment and start reporting it every single time. You have a right to use public services unmolested. You have a right to expect those services be kept safe from dangerous people, even if those people happen to be homeless. Use 988 if you truly believe the problem to be mental health related. Edit: typo",2024-08-28 08:46:04,47
comment,Aggressive homeless people on buses,Do not engage if you feel threatened and move up to the front of the bus near the driver. The driver can make them exit the bus if they are being threatening. If they ask for money on the bus or street say “I don’t have any cash on me” which is quite common now and they hear it a lot. If you want to give them some $$ get some 1s to give them and keep them in a separate area of your wallet so you don’t flash the rest of your money roll when you get it out. Most panhandlers in Chapel Hill are not aggressive if you don’t engage with them. Sometimes I will give them a $1 and sometimes I will just keep walking with eyes straight ahead and if they ask I either don’t respond or say I don’t have any cash. You can give money or volunteer with the IFC if you want to do something more: https://www.ifcweb.org. If you feel threatened call the cops. The Chapel Hill and Carrboro cops work on a community policing model and are generally pretty nice folks. Chapel Hill cops have had social workers as part of the department since the 1970s. They go out on calls for mental health/homelessness and try to get the person resources and keep them from harassing people. https://chapelboro.com/news/safety/chapel-hill-polices-crisis-unit-marks-50-years-honors-former-and-current-members,2024-08-28 09:56:58,17

comment,Aggressive homeless people on buses,"I don’t have a solution, but I empathize with you. I definitely feel bad for people, and my partner has given people a few dollars here and there, but it can also be scary/unsettling. I was walking on Franklin Street last year and a drunk, presumably homeless, man fell quite literally onto my feet and then started yelling at me as if I caused it. On another occasion, a clearly drunk and/or high man came up to my door (I live off campus but just slightly) and banged on it asking for money and then made throat-slit motions at me and cursed me out, screaming, when I closed my door on him. I had the screen door closed and locked, but the inside door was open so he saw me before I could pretend to not be home. I was alone and felt genuinely freaked out, I can’t have the door open at all anymore when I’m home. I feel bad for them, but I’m not sure what to do when it feels threatening. I just carry pepper spray and a pocket knife now.",2024-08-27 20:26:53,21
comment,Aggressive homeless people on buses,"Not sure if it was a student or resident but earlier walking to the bus stop at Abernathy (a couple hundred feet away still) there was a black guy in red yelling stuff like ""fuck this hoe"" and other stuff that was on the verge of threatening yet not actually a threat. I just walked by as fast as I could to prevent him from engaging with me. They could have been a student but more likely a homeless person who wandered off the main road. It's not nearly as bad as places like Vancouver and up north in general, but I definitely did not expect this to be a thing I'd have to deal with coming to UNC. I've considered packing sandwiches or pringles etc to give when they ask for money but I don't know if that is appropriate or if I'd get fussed at. I also don't mind giving out $5 but don't want to be known as the person to ask for money all the time.",2024-08-27 20:37:43,18

comment,Aggressive homeless people on buses,"I highly recommend sitting towards the front of the bus near the drivers. This probably isn’t true all of the time, but a lot of the drivers are used to dealing with repeat individuals who cause problems on the bus. I’ve seen a few of the drivers stand up for women on the bus and students getting harassed and kick people off. The bus drivers are good people and typically WILL stand up for you, and again I can’t speak for all of them. One of the bus drivers even got up once at a stop and stood between a woman and a homeless individual expressing violent ideation and was willing to protect this woman and enforce his boundaries as a driver. I know sometimes it’s not possible to sit near the drivers, especially when it’s crowded and in this situation it is perfectly acceptable to get up, walk to the front of the bus, and stand next to the driver while hanging on to the railing. You can tell the driver exactly what’s happening and why you’re there and I promise they will understand and they will most likely take up for you.",2024-09-01 12:06:35,5

comment,You’re going to be okay,"I would like to second this as someone who graduated. I thought I was losing my marbles every time finals rolled around, especially since a lot of classes had projects that counted as the final. If you're having a hard time, remember to take things one step at a time. Sometimes the project just isn't coming together and the exam information just won't get into your head. Take a deep breath and step away from what you're doing for a minute. It might help you to take some time to talk to a friend about the project or course material (it can be beneficial to hear information out loud) or write out a plan of action to help you get things done. If everything feels overwhelming, go get a drink of water, eat something, and come back to it. Taking a shower or going on a walk will do wonders in helping to clear your head. I've done tons of projects and study marathons through a haze of tears in the dead of night and I've gotten my fair share of grades that I wasn't thrilled with. Despite all that, I still graduated. OP is right, you will be okay. I promise that a low grade isn't the end of the world, even if it might feel like it. Just do your best and you will be fine. Btw, if you're struggling due to issues beyond your control, you might want to consider contacting your professor and explaining the situation. I've found that a lot of professors (and TAs) are really empathetic and truly want students to understand the information and succeed. Even if you don't get an extension, you might receive some words of advice or extra help in understanding the course material.",2021-11-30 02:45:16,15

comment,This has to be satire. Carolina Review ain’t this dumb. 🥴🥴🥴,"Actually, the only ""draconian restrictions"" that applied here were: 1) No gatherings of more than FIFTY people outdoors. That is a lot, since it's outdoors, the indoor limit is only ten. That's plenty of room for a big gathering, you just can't have literally the whole school in one block. 2) Must wear a mask when six foot distance cannot be maintained. This does not impede speech or assembly, it just requires you to wear a mask. Just like you can't run out in the street with no clothes at all. 3) No standing, sitting, or lying in a road to impede the flow of traffic. This is always in force, unless you have permission from the city which clearly was not granted this year, you don't get to run out into the street like this.

post,We're seven days from a government shutdown. Here's where things stand. - Rep. Jeff Jackson,"We're seven days from a government shutdown. Here's where things stand. - Rep. Jeff Jackson **Shutdown update** The government is set to shut down in seven days. There are two ways to avoid this: We can either pass a budget (which means passing 12 separate funding bills) or pass another temporary extension. In reality, there’s no way the House and Senate are going to agree on a full budget in the next seven days. The House has only passed seven funding bills so far and the House and Senate have agreed on zero of them. Even assuming everyone started working in good faith tomorrow, we’re still a couple months from an actual budget deal. So that leaves a temporary extension. BUT agreeing to a temporary extension is what got the last Speaker fired. The new Speaker knows this - and he doesn’t want to be fired - so his plan was to pass as many funding bills as he can *before* asking his right-flank to go along with another temporary extension next week. Basically, he wants to show his right-flank that he’s trying very hard to do things the way they want in the hope that they’ll cut him some slack when he inevitably tells them he has to do a temporary extension. (Which was roughly former Speaker McCarthy’s strategy, by the way.) This week, the Speaker’s goal was to pass two funding bills. Tuesday night we tried to pass the first one. We had been there for over an hour voting on all these random amendments for the bill, and then, at last, we reached the vote for the actual bill. And just before it came to a vote, leadership took it down. No vote. Same exact thing happened on the next funding bill. We had an hour of amendments leading up to the big vote on a funding bill, only to have the bill pulled off the agenda moments before the vote. Why? Because of internal division within the majority party about the bills themselves. In short, some members of the majority want deeper cuts than others. So, the Speaker’s plan didn’t work. Zero funding bills passed this week. Next week is decision time for the Speaker. He’s going to have to go to his caucus with another temporary extension, and I honestly don’t know how they’re going to react. The Speaker is hoping that his right-flank basically says, “Ok, we’re not going to vote for a temporary extension, but we also won’t try to fire you if you bring it to a vote and it passes.” If we’re going to avoid a shutdown, that’s roughly what needs to happen. I don’t think there’s another path. **Fake amendments / real amendments** I mentioned that we voted on lots of amendments this week. I just want to stress: A ton of these are fake efforts to get your attention. Some examples: * Reducing the salary of all employees of the Vice President to $1 (in other words, eliminate her entire staff) * Reducing the salary of the Secretary of the Dept. of Transportation to $1 * Reducing the salary of the White House Press Secretary to $1 * Reducing the salary of the Securities and Exchange Chairman to $1 * Reducing salary of National Highway Transportation Administration head to $1 These aren’t designed to be serious. They’re for members to use in their fundraising emails and certain media outlets. A genuine approach is less exciting, and it looks kinda like this: After I was elected, a handful of meteorologists from my district got in touch. They told me that Charlotte exists in a weather radar gap because the national weather radar network was built decades ago and back then we just didn’t get our own radar. We rely on a radar in South Carolina, and that means less accurate weather predictions for my district. So I filed a bill a few months ago to try and fix that. And then the work began. All kinds of issues developed with my bill, various objections were raised, modifications were made, partners were found. For something seemingly small, it became pretty tricky. Once we had a new version of the bill, we settled on a different strategy: We’d file it as an amendment to a related bill that we knew was going to come up in the Science Committee, of which I’m a member. And it finally happened this week. I had the opportunity to explain my amendment to my colleagues, and it passed unanimously. Then the bill itself passed, and now it’s headed for the floor. Also, I have to say: The Chairman of the Science Committee - who is not in my party - has been exceptionally kind and helpful all year. The fact that we’re in different parties doesn’t seem to matter to him one bit when it comes to working with me, and in a highly partisan environment I think he deserves a lot of credit for that. I'll keep you posted. \- Rep. Jeff Jackson",2023-11-10 11:40:29,151

post,No more Fall Fest (warning: rant),"No more Fall Fest (warning: rant) So far this has only been sent out to student organization leader's, but Fall Fest will not be happening anymore, at least in the capacity we have known it. Not because of COVID, but because of surveys reporting students felt ""overwhelmed"". It would have been fine if they just have written it off because of COVID, but I find it so odd that they have mislead student orgs since May saying there was going to be a Fall Fest, going so far as to create a website for it. And now with less than a month to go before Fall fest, they tell us Fall Fest will be for university and sponsor booths only. And if we would like, our club could volunteer at these university or sponsor booths while wearing T-shirts that advertise our student org. How are new students supposed to find new clubs? The whole point of Fall Fest was being overwhelmed, so that you knew about what was available at UNC. Many clubs at UNC (even the biggest, most mainstream) are struggling to find new members after Zoom Uni; so many of us were betting almost everything on Fall Fest. At least for my org alone, we would have 500 people sign up on our listserv at Fall fest compared to around 10 people when we would pub in the Pit or the quad. I'm not sure what sort of shitty cost cutting measure this is, now that they are relegating student orgs to the Pit a week to two weeks after school has started, meaning that most clubs will have already had their interest meetings. There are nearly what 900 student orgs at UNC, how the hell are all of those going to fit in the Pit in one week. Also, this ""Small Fest"" will take place mid-day. While the Pit does have high foot traffic during the day, I know many who cannot go to this event because they have classes. I mean fuck, most of my exec board will not be able to man the booth because they have classes (and we can't pick the date we're assigned!) The whole point of having Fall Fest before FDOC was so that EVERYONE could attend. For fuck's sake. I'm sorry but I needed to get this out there, especially since I know that most of the students here probably do not know about this yet. Again, I really would be okay if this is just a COVID thing, but clearly this is something that they are planning to continue after COVID dies down considering they didn't even write off the cancellation as a COVID prevention measure. Fall Fest was one of the few things that united the UNC community. It's truly a shame if new students will never be able to experience this.",2021-07-18 11:11:30,153

I know I'm not the only one, but I feel so alone.","Hey, as someone who was depressed pretty much all of high school, I really really need you to remember this: you do not have to give 100%. Right now is a really tough time, and our brains are not meant to deal with high levels of stress over a long period of time. In regards to the pandemic, and in regards to getting through this semester, take things one day at a time. It can be super overwhelming to think of things far in the future or even next week, but you’ve made it through every day of your life so far, so I know you can make it through some more. In regards to school, you sound like you’re a pretty ambitious person and you probably have high standards for yourself. But something really important to remember is that anything is better than nothing. Your first priority is yourself. School is pretty shit right now, but hey, we’re already a third of the way done! So for a short term survival plan to just get through this semester - do what you can, and more importantly don’t beat yourself up for not doing everything you’d be doing if we weren’t in a pandemic. We ARE in a pandemic. It’s totally okay and normal to feel the way you are feeling. You are not insane. You are not alone. If you can’t get out of bed to watch your lectures, watch them in bed. If you can’t bear to change out of your most comforting sweatshirt, keep it on. If you wish you had a teddy bear to hug because it would make you feel better, get a goddamn teddy bear. Whatever gets you through the day - don’t hold yourself to any meaningless standards like “I need to wear a better outfit” or “I need to stop feeling so unmotivated”. You do not! You just need to figure out healthy ways to keep going. Don’t compare your mental health to anyone else’s - comparison is the thief of joy, and your progress is your own. Bring this up to your professors, let them know you’re having a really tough time. Most profs barring the shitty ones will be understanding given the circumstances. Last spring semester, things were pretty hard for me, and I set up an arrangement with my physics professor to just turn in my assignments whenever I could, because there were days where I just couldn’t do homework. Physics was the class that took the most work for me last semester, so make sure to bring it up especially w the prof of your toughest class! Hopefully they will be as equally willing to work with you. Also, think about pass/fail for some of your classes. I hope this helps a bit! You’re not alone, I promise!",2020-09-11 19:36:53,16

comment,"Sleeping through classes😴. Saying I'm gonna watch them later🤫. Later never comes 😪. Just anxious about life 😰. I know I'm not the only one, but I feel so alone.","I know exactly how you feel. I am by nature a lazy/complacent person (you may not be, but depression makes any person like that), especially when it comes to school. You might find this relatable (or not idk), but when it comes to school, I don't have any issue comprehending the material, I do have an issue finding the motivation to get the work done. One thing that has helped me with my depressive tendencies is sectioning off at least 30 minutes every day to do something that I find personally fulfilling, which for me is writing. Just remember that college is hard for everyone (especially right now with everything being online) and what you do, and how you do, in college, isn't necessarily predictive of your future. You are not alone in how you feel. Also, know that there are resources out there like CAPS (it's not always the best but it's still something). If you need someone to vent to feel free to shoot me a PM. :)",2020-09-11 12:41:19,7

post,Jewish Voices for Peace on Zionism & Antisemitism (with additional resources),"Jewish Voices for Peace on Zionism & Antisemitism (with additional resources) There have been constant attempts on this sub and elsewhere to equate all criticism of Israel and Zionism with antisemitism. **To be very clear, antisemitism is real, wrong, and incredibly dangerous. But those who insist on conflating criticism of Israel and zionism are not doing so in good faith.** In fact, this is a classic tactic of the Israeli propaganda machine utilized for over a century to delegitimize calls for Palestinian liberation. It's much easier to deter resistance by convincing the general populace that those seeking freedom are dangerous. The same tactic has been used by any number of oppressive groups. I'm posting a few resources here, including a statement from the [Jewish Voices for Peace](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/), a group that has led many of the most notable protests and movements for Palestinian liberation since the most recent Israeli attacks on Gaza. I'm pleading with readers here to resist the pro-Israeli commentators that tend to flood Reddit, especially during times like this. Instead, please refer to your humanity. No humans deserve to die in the crossfires of war, and we should indeed be outraged by any and all deaths we've witnessed in the past month. What we are witnessing is the culmination of a century-long attempt by Israel and pro-Israeli nations to subjugate the Palestinian people. If you condemn the attacks by Hamas without acknowledging the violent oppression that led to Hamas' creation or condemning the indiscriminate brutality Israel has perpetrated against civilians since October 7, you're simply perpetuating the very violence you claim to condemn. In these resources, I've included statements and other information about the [National Students for Justice in Palestine](https://nationalsjp.org/). There have been unverified claims about the group's ties with antisemitism, but these claims are made by many of the same groups who wish to obscure the issue of Palestinian liberation from Israel's apartheid control by associating the movement with antisemitism. I hope you will approach these claims with skepticism as well. Instead of believing claims made by those who oppose Palestinian liberation, follow and interact with [the UNC chapter](https://heellife.unc.edu/organization/SJP) to see their own statements and work to make your own decisions about their stance. **Resources** * [JEWISH VOICES FOR PEACE: OUR APPROACH TO ZIONISM](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/resource/zionism/) * [Statement from the National Students for Justice in Palestine & Jewish Voices for Peace](https://nationalsjp.org/the-movement-for-palestinian-rights-will-not-be-silenced) * [The National Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP): Purpose, Mission, Vision, Values](https://nationalsjp.org/about) * [Supporting Palestinian rights is antisemitic because Israel wants it to be](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/how-jews-can-support-palestinian-rights-condemn-antisemitism-ncna1268680) ([Abraham Gutman](https://www.huffpost.com/author/abgutman-362), 2021) * [BLOWBACK: HOW ISRAEL WENT FROM HELPING CREATE HAMAS TO BOMBING IT](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/) (The Intercept, 2018) * [What's the Israel-Hamas Conflict About?

OP is just using Jewish Voices For Peace as his token Jews trying to legitimize his hate for Israel like many anti zionists do with ultra orthodox “Neturei Karta” who are an extremely fringe group of messianic Jews who are Anti Zionist and frequently used as straw men and token Jews when one wants to be anti Israel while justifying himself by pointing at a religious Jew and saying “they’re Jewish so I couldn’t be an antisemite” You’re welcome to downvote me all you want but anyone who actually knows Jewish people outside of their echo chamber would know what I’m saying is true.,2023-11-01 23:39:38,8

Maybe BDS, JVP, and most western supporters of these groups aren't antisemitic.

Anti-zionists should be very careful to avoid veering into antisemitism, but all Zionism is anti-Palestinian.

comment,Jewish Voices for Peace on Zionism & Antisemitism (with additional resources),"So Israel has a military and this is acceptable, but any similar Palestinian action is immediately (appropriately) condemned? By what logic is it ok for Israel to possess and use missiles but not Palestians? I am not justifying terrorism in any way, Hamas killings are horrific like all killings. But only hamas is condemned and there is no commentary on Israel actions when the actual reality is that the majority of brutality originates from Israel. 2018: 32,000 palestians killed, 130 Israelis killed. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.statista.com/chart/amp/16516/israeli-palestinian-casualties-by-in-gaza-and-the-west-bank/",2023-11-01 23:34:10,6
comment,Jewish Voices for Peace on Zionism & Antisemitism (with additional resources),"Israel should stop engaging in apartheid and the genocidal occupation of Palestinian territories. That's it. That's the answer. Oppression creates resistance. Violent oppression gives birth to violent resistance. If Israel really cared about stopping Hamas, it would stop oppressing the Palestinian people. The groups in question are neither antisemitic or ""uncritically accepting"" any arguments in favor of antisemitism. To associate calls for liberation with fears of ""slaughter"" is, once again, a tactic that oppressive regimes have long used to deter resistance. It's easier to delegitimize any movement if you convince the general populace that those calling for freedom are dangerous. By continuing this kind of thinking, you place yourself on the side of a long line of oppressive groups. \[Edited for clarity\]",2023-11-01 14:06:51,18

When asked, who did what (be honest)... the professor is placing the over achieving introverts in a weird spot...should we say that members x,y and z did fudge all...or accept your oversized workload and move forward.... the former is uncomfortable and the latter is unfortunate, and neither is fair. Graduate school group projects are different. 1. Some problem sets take 60+ hours... with two weeks to complete. So individual work isn't an option. 2. There will still be a few who have trouble keeping up, but it isn't because of laziness, it's because the work is insanely difficult. 3. At the end of the day we're in it together.

post,"If you have to retake classes, it’s okay.","If you have to retake classes, it’s okay. As someone that’s retaking two “easy” low level classes this semester, I understand how scary it can be. I’m a junior, and it feels like the world is ending because I’m having to retake classes my third year. I, like many of us here, finished high school at the top of the class, and I wasn’t ready for how hard failing is to accept sometimes. I FREAKED out when I saw my low grades, because I’d never had to deal with them before. But you’re okay. I openly talk about failing and retaking classes with the hope that others won’t feel so ashamed or embarrassed. Even before COVID it wasn’t uncommon, and COVID just made things harder for a lot of people. You’re doing great! this is a notoriously difficult university—we are literally top 30 in the country. As a psychology major going for a B.A., I’ve had people tell me it’s “the easiest major,” and one person even said that going to humanities classes compared to STEM was like “going back to elementary school.” But no major is easy, and each major has a different kind of skill set (do you know how hard clinical psychology is?! sheesh!!!). But back to the original point: you’re doing fine. If you’re retaking classes because you failed them all last semester like I did, it’s okay. It happens. You’re here because you’re meant to be here. I had to make a SAP Appeal to get financial aid again; it was scary, but it worked out, and I’m working hard to get things going again. You can do it! Don’t let the “failing is embarrassing and the worst thing that can happen” mentality get to you. All you can do is your best, and everyone fails sometimes. And hey, if you have to take it two or three times, you’re amazing for trying over and over. That takes so much willpower and strength. Keep going!

comment,Chrome Extension to speed up registration by displaying RateMyProfessor ratings next to professor names,"very cool extension, though i would add a note of caution. ryp is hugely subjective and not always the best guide to how a prof is gonna be. one of the best classes i’ve ever had was with a 2.0, and one of the worst was a 4.5. just remember you have no idea who is writing those reviews. something i like is asking professors whose style you like to recommend other profs in their/adjacent departments",2020-11-28 01:07:34,5

comment,"remember that time our uni peppersprayed black activists, then gave 2.5 mil to the SCV, then had the audacity to post blackouttuesday","Amen. UNC and Chapel Hill police have decades of experience terrorizing Black students and community members. UNC's official line after police brutalized, pepper sprayed, and arbitrarily arrested students and community members a year ago was that allegations of police brutality were ""nonsense"" and the police did nothing wrong. Not to mention the countless times UNC police lied on the stand to try and convict innocent students of crimes they did not commit. UNC can't say shit until they start divesting in their own campus police force (and no, a powerless safety commission built to pretend like admin is ""listening to concerns"" doesn't mean shit). +1 plug for the TACH bail fund.",2020-06-02 14:26:44,47
comment,"remember that time our uni peppersprayed black activists, then gave 2.5 mil to the SCV, then had the audacity to post blackouttuesday","Its important to keep in mind UNC leadership is not one person, while these events are hypocritical its probably not the concensus among UNC administration that black activists should be peppersprayed or give 2.5 mill to SCV.",2020-06-02 16:08:43,10

comment,"remember that time our uni peppersprayed black activists, then gave 2.5 mil to the SCV, then had the audacity to post blackouttuesday","Faculty and school-level UNC administration are two very different things. There's scant reason to give the benefit of the doubt to UNC-CH administration when there truly isn't a doubt: every single step of the way they have defended actions of their police force and the UNC BOG decision. There are so many examples I can give to show this, but perhaps the best evidence is [video of Kevin G. himself after the announcement of the million dollar settlement to racists.](https://twitter.com/liebknickt/status/1203773263043796995) In short, it's foolish to trust that UNC admin at any level will do the right things on their own. They need to be pushed and pressured to do anything remotely close to moral when it comes to defying the BOG and their police force. Actions speak louder than words, and words speak louder than any beliefs one holds privately but refuses to even say. So even if it's true that ""its probably not the concensus among UNC administration that black activists should be peppersprayed or give 2.5 mill to SCV"" (something I don;t believe at all)...that hypothetical would be meaningless anyway based on the words they actually say and the actions they take.",2020-06-02 21:40:58,11

post,I was accepted to UNC! I’ve come a long way from being a high school drop out.,"I was accepted to UNC! I’ve come a long way from being a high school drop out. I’m sharing this because I would have wanted to see this prior to submitting my application. I fell in love with UNC for many reasons, but it was the Communications program that got me hooked originally as I am a Comm major. I saw the acceptance rate for freshman and thought it would be damn near impossible for me to get in. Then I researched further. Transfer rate for in state looked better, but out of state? Not so much. I didn’t know what my chances would actually be. Little backstory... I got my GED after dropping out of high school in tenth grade after a traumatic childhood and moving several years in a row. I despised school at the time. I was a horrible student. 😬I eventually came around to the idea of starting college at age 27. I had one child at the time and it was rough since I had to take a years worth of remedial courses. I wanted to stop so many times. I also had to to take two breaks after starting since I went on to have two more babies. I am now 34, a mother of 3, and I am more determined than I’ve ever been in my life to finish my degree. I applied to UNC this past February right at the deadline for Fall 2021. I wanted to see if someone like me could actually get in. I almost did not apply because I did not want to get let down. After submitting my application, I knew my chances were slim, but I was prepared for the answer! After waiting and waiting AND WAITING, I saw an email come through last week that a decision had been made. I was putting my youngest one down for a nap and then raced to my computer. I could not believe my eyes when I read: “Congratulations...” I’m telling this very shortened story for the reason I mentioned up above. I want to give someone else hope and encouragement. Always do your best and do your best in everything that you do. I am a high school drop out that applied to UNC and got in. I did not submit test scores, I have almost 74 hours (I’m in school now taking 17 hours) and will get my AA next month. My GPA is a 3.78 for anyone that cares. My advice to anyone that is doubting themselves? APPLY, but not only to UNC (or any other dream school), but to loving yourself, believing in yourself and staying focused. Persistence is key! Sending love and light to y’all. Thanks for reading this. I hope it inspires someone out there that might have a similar background. I am here to answer any questions anyone may have about anything!",2021-04-13 23:55:05,140

I don't know what your own capabilities are, but your PMA is going to help you out when the going gets tough (it will).

post,Petition to Extend Pass/Fail Deadline until after Finals,"Petition to Extend Pass/Fail Deadline until after Finals UPDATE: \*Disclaimer: I am not an auditory learner and am very sleep deprived at the moment, but this is my best interpretation of what I heard. In the Fall Health Town Hall held by student gov. on Nov. 12th, the Dean of Students said that this pass/fail petition is known about and has been discussed, and it is pretty much a final decision that the pass/fail deadline will not be moved. Reasons given were that those deciding this felt that faculty have been better prepared this semester to teach online compared to spring, and that the current pass/fail deadline is already more generous than normal. The Dean of Students did also acknowledge that the administration is aware that many students don't have the majority of their grades back, and said they are making efforts (emailing department heads/faculty was one thing I heard) to have faculty get those back to students on or before LDOC. \---------- Original Post ---------- Didn't create this, just passing along since we've had a pretty great petition game since all this started. Petition to move the pass/fail deadline until after finals. Link: [http://chng.it/Km5MqLJrFX](http://chng.it/Km5MqLJrFX) Edit: About 2.3k signatures right now! ***Petition reasoning:*** ""According to a WRAL article written by Laura Leslie, statistics show that 25% of UNC-Chapel Hill students reported suffering from anxiety and 33% from depression since the global CoronaVirus pandemic. This marks a 40% increase since last fall for anxiety and an almost 50% increase for depression."" ""Most of our course finals are worth 20-40% of our final grade. Many professors do not readily update the Sakai page grade book, so not only do we not know what our final grade would be, we don't know our current grade standing."" ***My reasoning (because we definitely care about my opinion <3):*** We don't have reading days guys. This isn't a normal finals season, and we aren't being given the same opportunity to succeed as in semesters' past. So please sign if you agree!

post,Here's what happens right after you get elected to Congress - Jeff Jackson,"Here's what happens right after you get elected to Congress - Jeff Jackson Hey UNC, I thought you might appreciate a (non-partisan) first-person account of what it looks like right after you're elected to Congress - in part because it's just interesting, but also because transparency is good and you should expect more. So here goes. In short, winning a congressional election sets off a whirlwind that quickly envelops you and your family. Lots of people suddenly swoop in and fill your schedule, and they start by getting you up to D.C. pretty quick. Your security situation changes very fast. You get briefings about steps that will now be taken to protect you and your family. It was more than I expected. January 3rd is our official swear-in date, but being ready to serve constituents at that very moment requires a lot of prep work. That means lots of conversations about getting on the right committees (seniority is important, but they also take regional representation seriously) and which members are leading the charge in different policy areas and what kind of software we need to handle the volume of email we’ll receive each day (it turns out there are competing vendors in this space and they all make very definitive claims about the superiority of their product). In between those conversations, I'm conducting interviews for staff positions. We've received a flood of resumes from lots of really exceptional people and it's a humbling part of the process to choose among them to put together our team. I can already tell it's going to be a very, very strong team. Much of my ability to serve constituents will flow through them, so it's really important that I get this part of the process right. There have been some IT conversations that have made me feel young. Example: When they gave me my laptop, they looked me dead in the eye and asked with total sincerity if I needed help turning it on. It gave me the feeling that maybe I wasn't their average congressional customer. Then there’s the surreal stuff, the moments that felt like I was in a wax museum that had come to life. I’ve followed national politics for years, but most of the people I’m meeting now are ones I’ve only known as two-dimensional characters in our national political drama. My image of them is built from snippets on TV, quotes in the paper, tweets and ads. To suddenly be shaking hands with them - as they welcomed me to the building we’ll work in together - was pretty strange. To their credit, they were all exceptionally kind. &#x200B; [Speaker Pelosi announced she wouldn't be seeking a leadership position in the next Congress, which wasn't something I expected to personally witness my first week in D.C.](https://preview.redd.it/sqerswvnnq1a1.jpg?width=2013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6b05d2581bfb9f76c699d8d2c231b63d469ec43) I’ve also never been offered so much coffee in my life. Every meeting began with someone asking if I’d like some. The whole place seems to run on it. I got lots of practice politely declining as I try to stick to one cup per day. (That said, my donut consumption has spiked.) One of the real joys has been meeting other new members. It’s a young freshman class. Lots of young families, lots of stories about bringing kids on the campaign trail. For those of you who have told me you’re interested in seeing a new generation of leadership, you’re about to. &#x200B; [Freshman class of the 118th Congress](https://preview.redd.it/mji4rwmqnq1a1.jpg?width=794&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d67eebb7e4efef51665025b6e8e7d2adddbe01f) Regular politics has also begun, but not in the way you might expect. Internal politics is where the energy is right now, especially with the top three House Democratic leaders - Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, and Majority Whip Clyburn - recently announcing that they’re not seeking those leadership positions. I’m getting lots of calls from members congratulating me on our win, graciously offering to be of assistance during the transition, and - “hey just one more thing” - asking for my support for a position. It’s been an interesting way to meet some of my colleagues. One of the best parts was that Marisa was able to be there with me. Ever since my first campaign we’ve always approached this challenge as a team, so to be able to spend my first week in D.C. with her by my side just felt right. Going forward, I want to give you something we don’t see often: a real-time, first-person account of serving in Congress. I think sharing that perspective is part of my job, but I also just think you’ll find it interesting. Best, Jeff Jackson",2022-11-23 12:55:06,138

comment,Here's what happens right after you get elected to Congress - Jeff Jackson,"Congratulations Congressman - I am very pleased to see another recent vet elevated to Congress - your experience in Afghanistan will, I hope, guide your thinking when other international conflicts move beyond what diplomacy and trade sanctions can mitigate. Always remember you represent the good Peoples of your District - not your Party, not North Carolina as a whole, and certainly not America. Our Founders made the House first among equals for a reason - and the reason was because Representatives were closest to their electorate. Alliances and politics must always serve the fundamental values and priorities of your District, otherwise they are a slippery slope to becoming a Celebrity Politician serving the pressed priorities of a seasoned press corps ending in Lord Acton's cautionary wisdom. I do not agree with most of your policy positions, but I hope you will represent those positions transparently and honorably for those who voted for you.

post,Student Protest at Wilson on Wednesday 12:00 PM-5:00 PM,"Student Protest at Wilson on Wednesday 12:00 PM-5:00 PM In light of recent events, students at UNC have decided to protest UNC's failure to provide adequate mental health resources and the failure to speak on these topics. So many students keep dying, and UNC has done nothing but under-fund CAPS and sweep issues under the rug. Make signs and spread the word! EDIT: It will be a silent protest and word has it that DTH will be covering this. A petition has been made to increase the funding for CAPS. [https://chng.it/v7yDMRWPyj](https://chng.it/v7yDMRWPyj) Thank you to everyone for the support for the cause, and I hope to see everyone on Wednesday! ANOTHER EDIT: POSTPONING PROTEST New Date: Friday, October 29th, same place and time! \- The petition will remain up for those who want to spread information about the cause. Feel free to contact me if you are willing to help out for the new date. Hi, everyone. After some advice given, it has been decided that it is better off to postpone this protest. While CAPS does need reform, now is not the time to focus on that. What needs the focus are the students and families who are going through this loss and need support. This was never meant to be selfish or for personal gain, but to encourage healing and growth and honor the students that we have lost. Of course, no time will be long enough to fully heal from this, and I encourage everyone to support the parents who are coming out on Thursday from 11-3PM to join them in solidarity. My heart goes out to the friends and family affected by this loss. Everyone, stay safe, take care of each other, and spread love. You are loved, appreciated, and you are enough. &#x200B;",2021-10-10 00:16:17,136

We can’t just, in my opinion, go and yell about how CAPS isn’t helpful. They have practices, like turning people away that aren’t “sick” enough, that I hate and think need to stop right now. That’s a good specific. What do we need as students right now? Available counseling for everyone? That would probably require more funding for CAPS, which maybe should come from athletics or elsewhere. Do we need wellness days?",2021-10-10 14:27:29,29

Unfortunately I am only one person, so it's been a lot to organize all of this! 1) We do want more funding for CAPS, and the petition linked is specifically for that! 2) CAPS needs to provide counseling and long term therapy for EVERYONE who needs it. No one should be turned away, no matter what. No one should be told that they cannot be helped or don't need help if they are asking for it 3) Mental wellness days should be provided, and the university/professors need to be more accommodating when it comes to asking for extensions based on our mental health needs. My experience with CAPS has also been very annoying when they try to refer me to other resources during my session instead of actually helping me then and there- I am trying to use these brief therapy sessions as much as I can to get as much as possible out of them, and it is hard to do that when I am constantly bringing up an issue and told to make an appointment with someone else because they ""can't help"" me. It honestly feels like they are just shoving my issues onto someone else. I understand that this is mainly due to resources, but that's also why more funding is needed. I hope no one has had this same experience. I do plan on making pamphlets for this and posters to explain the demands.

post,Public records show process of CS major admissions fumble,"Public records show process of CS major admissions fumble # TL;DR The department and the College of Arts and Sciences leadership miscommunicated about whether or not the department had a final go-ahead to implement the admissions process. The CAS was initially open to the idea, but in their view had never given a formal approval. For his part, Dr. Jeffay felt that he had never been told there was anything standing in his way of implementing the changes. Dean Terry Rhodes ordered the changes to be cancelled after learning of the email to all majors. She later stated to a DTH reporter that Dr. Jeffay's announcement was ""premature."" Additionally, emails show a longstanding frustration between the departmental leadership and the college/university-level leadership regarding a percieved apathy/inattention to the growth challenges of the CS department. ___ ### Disclaimer *Nota bene:* The following was reconstructed from emails obtained via a public records request to UNC. Since these requests take a few months of processing time, this does not represent any developments that occurred after April 8, 2021. Additionally, due to the narrow nature of records requests, the emails obtained in response may not tell the complete story. Over 500 pages of emails were recieved, not all of which are reproduced here. Text in [*brackets*] represents additions by me to clarify quotes. **Link to full records obtained:** https://archive.org/details/unc-pr-21-148 ___ # Initial Planning On February 27th, Department Chair Jeffay wrote to Senior Associate Deans Cable and Panter as follows. This appears to be the first record in the release of discussions beyond the department concerning the changes. > **Subject: FYI on a looming ""admissions"" process for the CS major...** > Jaye/Abigail As we've discussed, we need to reduce the size of the CS major. We've considered a number of schemes to algorithmically reduce the size of the major through enrollment restrictions (seat caps and & course prereqs) but all of these so far have too many downsides. Thus, while we'd like t avoid it, we're leaning towards a more traditional admissions process that we'll (somehow) run in-house. Attached is a strawman proposal. > Part of the appeal of the algorithmic approach was it wouldn't consume already scarce faculty cycles and we assumed it wouldn't require any approvals external to the dept. A question is if we do an actual admissions process can we just role this out or does the College need to vet this? > Thanks... The attached proposal clearly stated the general plan for the application and the fact that current students at or below COMP210 would not necessarily be able to continue. On March 17, Dr. Jeffay first contacted advising to request a moratorium on new CS BA/BS major declarations, notifying them that an admissions process was planned for Fall. The next day, advising leadership worked on the following draft response (it was unclear if this was actually sent--it seems that a meeting may have been used to deliver it instead) with their concerns. They clearly concluded that neither they nor the department had the authority to impose this without approval from CAS: > Dear Kevin, >Thanks for reaching out. Please not that niether I nor Chloe Russell, the Associate Dean and Director of Acaemic Advising, have the power to make this decision. I note that you cc'd both Jaye Cable and Abigail Panter on the email. The decision will likely be made at or above their level (possibly by Terry Rhodes). Here are my thoughts: > 1) I understand the pressure that increasing student enrollment is putting upon Computer Science faculty. >2) I also understand that, although you have approval for open postitions, the nationwide competition for qualified instructors is stiff and will only grow worse. > 3) I understand that an admissions process makes sense, but would request that it be implemented with students entering the university in Fall 2021 or later. > My concern is the request that we halt major declarations for current students. In the past, when a change to and admissions-based process has been made, it has been effective with students entering the University in the next catalog year. This was the path taken by the Joint Biomedical Engineering program when an admissions process was approved. Only those students entering in Fall 2016 and after were required to go through the admissions process to declare BME. Students who entered the univeristy in Fall 2015 and before were still allowed to declare the major, even in subsequent years, if they were on track to complete requirements within the eight semester limit. > I am particularly concerned about imposing a ban on declaring either the COMP BA or the COMP BS for current first year students and on sophomores.. These students came to UNC with the understanding that they could declare Computer Science (or any other Arts and Science major with the exception of BME) through the end of their 4th semester. Students in later years who have managed to get through the COMP core would also be an issue, if they are able to complete the major with the current 'two before three' rule. > If a Computer Science admissions plan goes into effect for next Fall, it will be really critical to notify Admissions NOW as students are beginning to commit to UNC for F21. We don't want to be accused of 'bait and switch' during Orientation. Students could argue that, had they known about the new process, they would have gone to a different institution. [n.b. -- these two points were the main student complaints, which advising clearly recognized from day one--why were they not effectively addressed? And how does cutting enrollment drastically (i.e. intentionally creating a shortage of seats) improve the situation from incoming students' POV?] > I understand that this decision will be made a the level of the College, but request that current students be taken into account when the decision is made. Later in the day, the Assistant Dean of Advising told the Associate Dean that she was ""disappointed at the College's decision not to hold current students harmless, but will deal with this new reality."" This seems to indicate that someone in CAS had given at least preliminary approval to the plan and had gone so far as to okay making it effective immediately for current undergrads. On March 8th, an email was sent to Vice Chancellor of Finance and Ops Knuffman, which addressed the ""28 T/TT [tenure or tenure-track] faculty for 1,800 majors"" issue and stated that CS was ""putting in measures now to reduce that to ~1,000 to 1,200."" The email appeared to be a plea for some kind of funding improvements in response.. Dean of CAS Terry Rhodes replied with ""Fingers crossed."" On March 18, Dr. Jeffay sent the following frustrated email to Provost Bob Blouin: > Bob I assume you've been briefed on Google's plans to move the Cloud division to NC. I've known about this for some time through highly placed alums at Google but was asked not to discuss the matter. But now it's public: [urls to newspapers omitted] > I'm just venting here so feel free to stop reading but the irony that Google is making a massive investment in core, bedrock, computer science while the CS program here is having to cut it's ugrad program by 50%, despite pleading for resources for 10 years, is nothing short of amazing (at least to me). When built out, Google will spend more on creature comforts for its employees (e.g., food) at this one facility than all of UNC-CH spends on all of computer science. I get it that resources have been, and always will be, scarce, and that the demands are overwhelming and meritorious. **But in my tenure on campus, CS has gone from the biggest and best CS program in the state to being the 3rd largest (4th if you put Duke in the mix), and now on par w/ NC State in terms of ranking. As Google builds out, none of us should be surprised that they look far more to State & Duke than to Chapel Hill. This can't bode well for the campus. And it didn't have to be this way.** [emphasis mine] Just sharing some thoughts... On March 24, Associate Dean Russell included the following concerns in an email to CAS leadership, including Dean Rhodes: > I shared with him that from a process perspective, this is not difficult, and we can absolutely stop majors from being declared. My concern is the communication plan for students as this has the potential to cause quite a bit of panic, unnecessary referrals to the department and calls to the Chancellor's Office. These concerns, of course, pretty well mirror what actually happened. In earlier March emails, the advising leadership also raised concerns about students being caught by surprise by this news. ___ # Announcement to Majors As everyone knows, on Monday, April 5th, at 10:37 PM, Department Chair Kevin Jeffay emailed all current CS majors and students in COMP intro courses announcing immediate changes to the major and a future admissions progress planned for the Fall. Advising leadership was copied on the April 5th announcement, and they forwarded this to all advisers, notifying them to stop allowing new major declarations. The email is well known and not reproduced here, search previous posts on this sub to see it. Associate Dean of Advising Russell included the following in the email to advisers: > A final point that not included in the email is that effective immediately, we will not be processing new declarations for the Computer Science major (BA or BS track). *I recognize that this is not ideal however, we've been asked by the department and the College's leadership to do so.* [emphasis mine] We will have questions as a result of this abrupt change and we're working to confirm the department's visit at our meeting next week. ___ # Cancellation On April 6th at 5:21:11 PM, Dr. Jeffay replied to his announcement email, to cancel the changes: > Folks -- An update. The plans outlined in the email below have been suspended and the status quo will remain in place. As a result there will be no Town Hall meeting scheduled for next week. > Best... Unsurprisingly, Dr. Jeffay subsequently received a number of emails asking for the reason, mostly from professors within the department. He responded to most with a request to discuss by phone instead--a common tactic used by public employees to keep their comments off the radar of public records requests. For example, Jack Snoeyink asked, ""Are we being bailed out, or is it time to pursue exit strategies?"" However, Dr. Jeffay did reply to one professor on April 7th, confirming the source of the about-face: > Yes, we'll chat on Friday. Short story is that I got called in on the carpet by the Dean and was given a cease and desist order. > [follow up reply] > [Professor's name] -- you are absolutely correct that I was keeping the College in the loop. I intend to show emails on Friday so that all can see what has transpired here. > The College is large and ponderous. I work with folks in the left side of the house and someone on the right side of house jumps up and says ""what the hell's going no here?!"" > It's so absurd/depressing... At 5:28, Associate Dean of Advising Chloe Russell replied to a question from within the advising department asking about the cancellation as follows: > From what I was just told, it's coming from Terry. At 6:24 PM, Dean of CAS Terry Rhodes gave the following statement to a DTH reporter. The Chancellor and Provost Blouin were copied directly. > The message that went out last night to computer science majors was premature. We are evaluating many options and no decisions have yet been made on how to handle these challenges. ___ # Post-mortem Discussions Evidently, a meeting was scheduled for April 7th between Dr. Jeffay and CAS leadership. Dr. Jeffay sent the following scathing email at 8:45 PM on April 6th to Dean of CAS Rhodes and Senior Assoc Dean Cable: > **Subject: Homework for tomorrow's meeting:** > Ladies -- Allow me to share the following w/ you. And I would very much appreciate it if you could review these before our meeting tomorrow. The point of all of this is to demonstrate that (1) I've never said anything incorrect or inaccurate, and (2) I've been working on these issues for a full 7 years 7 years of platitudes from the college and no traction, (3) your sense of how the dept has been given a wealth of positions/resources/soecial treatment is not borne out by the data. > 1) Slide 1 from my first presentation to Kevin G. as SAD in 2014. This was my first attempt to engage the College in a discussion about how to have a sustainable SC program. And this, like every other attempt, went no where. Zero engagement. (You're welcome to see the whole slide deck but I won't bore you with the details.) > 2) Slide deck from two years later as I try to engage Chris Clemens on the plight of CS. Mostly went nowhere. > 3) The famous, but completely abandoned, ""resource plan."" This took several hundred hours of faculty time to develop and was an insanely conservative plan. This was particularly hurtfull for the dept because we purposefully ""sucked it up"" because we thought substantial resources were coming. I believe several of the faculty departures were because of this. > 4) Spreadsheet showing the evolution of faculty in the CS over the last 20 years. It's a busy spreadsheet but it's accurate. It documents that at the end of this semester we will have 27 TT faculty. One fewer than what we had when I started as Chair in 2014. > 5) Spreadsheet showing CAS state dollars in CS faculty salaries is terms of dollars ""leaving"" the dept when folks depart and ""entering"" the dept when folks are hired. To be clear: someone like Kate would pick these data apart as the story of faculty funding is neither simple nor straightforward and this doesn't include other contributions to the dept like retention dollars. Back the take home message is clear: there has been NO investment in tenure track faculty. No increase either in dollars or numbers. Second, even counting TAPS, on its face the data suggest there's been a decrease in overall CAS state dollars going into CS faculty. And to the extent a different analysis would show a different result, it can't be a significant difference. On April 6 at 9:52 PM, Dr. Jeffay again wrote to Dean Rhodes, forwarding his February 27th email that was reproduced in the first section: > Terry -- Lest you think the CS is rouge organization I submit the following. Please note the last sentence. I *explicitly* [emphasis original] asked about the required approval process. My intent here is not to throw Jaye or Abilgail under the bus as both have been extremely helpful and supportive. We had discussion where we discussed any required approval process and no one suggested that further approvals were required. So due diligence was performed here. A few minutes later, he forwarded another email to Dr. Rhodes: > Again, this is not a CYA effort. I'm just trying to emphasize that I thought I was operating with the approval of the appropriate members of the college leadership and was keeping them informed at every step of the way. > At no time did anyone give any indication that we could not proceed. The forwarded email, from Dr. Jeffay to Drs. Cable and Panter dated March 11th, is reproduced below: > **Subject: On reducing the size of the CS major...** > Jaye/Abigail -- The cmte charged with coming up w/ the ""number"" for the size of the major is recommending that effectively we cut the program in half and that this happen immediately. The rational for 1/2 is complex but is based on a detailed analysis of teaching capacity and target class sizes (turns out it's more driven by teaching capacity for upper division classes so class sizes are less important). > And the rationale for doing this now is that with Bishop's retirement we can't make a teaching schedule for the Fall that will meet the demands of the majors unless we cap the number that proceed beyond the intro courses. Forwarding Dr. Jeffay's first 4/6 email to them, Dean Rhodes asked Senior Assoc Deans Cable and Panter if they had responded to the 2/27 email that it referenced. Dr. Cable's reply follows. Dr. Panter replied in agreement and added, ""I should have responded. I had assumed we would see the final plan for review."" > Terry, >This email was addressed over zoom after our Leadership meeting and before the March 11 email when Abigail and I met with him. We did not tell him he needed to go through the Ad Board, but we did ask for further review. That is why Chloe Russell met with Kevin. > Again, in Kevin's haste to make this happen, and *my inattention to the problem because of the merger* [italicized text was underlined in original], we were not acting as fast as Kevin apparently needed responses. > Jaye Dr. Rhodes also forward Jeffay's second 4/6 email to Drs. Cable and Panter, again asking if they had responded. Dr. Cable responded as follows on April 8th at 8:52 AM: > HI Terry, > Abigail and I met with him to discuss the plan after our discussion of this at Leadership. At the time, we did not disagree with him about an admissions process, but we did ask him to include a phase-in process and to consider this a temporary process until the department faculty size could be increased. We also talked about holistic reviews. Kevin's chief concern was the urgency of making a plan, because he had imminent faculty departures impacting teaching capacity . It was a conversation, and we left it that he was in agreement on the phase-in approach. He had pushed back on the holistic review process due to the peopletime required. He never got back in touch with a new plan detailing how he would approach the application process. > **The break down seems to me to be caused by him assuming that by speaking with us, he had covered the necessary steps. And, some urgency due to his worry about getting this done quickly so they could come up with a fall/spring teaching schedule.** [emphasis mine] > This email below was in direct response to one of our questions in the meeting where we asked him how he arrived at the number of majors to cut. He was adding context with his email below. >Abigail, does this sound accurate? >Jaye Dr. Panter subsequently responded as follows: > Dear Terry and Jaye, >Yes, I agree with what Jaye has described here about our discussions and the progression. We also suggested that he consult with University Counsel so they could have a chance to raise issues. We had spoken to them before about this topic but it was time for another consultation. > After our meeting I also had to let advising know that it was ok to plan with Kevin. Advisors had never seen an admissions process in the College — so they were hesitant to even begin planning. > [n.b. -- This was one of the unusual things about the change that may have raised concerns within CAS leadership. Previously, only (all?) professional schools at UNC required applications, whereas all CAS majors did not. In other words, there was precedent for applying to schools, but not to majors within a school. The exception was the BME program, since that involved dual enrollment with NC State.] > Sending my best, > Abigail",2021-05-26 16:42:10,139

I feel like the department's just 'stuck' -- we have ridiculously amazing profs like Jordan (and others who I haven't and won't get to take), but have other professors teaching vital classes (I may be biased here, but I don't like KMP and Majikes was nice... but I wouldn't take anything besides an intro under him) who have taught it the same way for years now (not that that's BAD... it's just not adaptive). To add to that, I just finished 555 w/ McMillan -- the course is rly closely aligned with what he's done in past semesters. Granted, the course was fine (and the grade inflation thanks to our TA... saved the entire class from Cs but I'm not complaining), but when I tried to enroll in 572 despite having the prereqs (just under different names), the prof teaching it never got back to me over the course of like 3 weeks. I wasn't Straight Outta COMP110 (116 w/ Majikes... yay), but I've heard both success and horror stories from that class -- moving to Python was something that genuinely excited me (and made me jealous bc I could've had Jordan twice if it'd happened a year earlier). After the intro class, it really seems like the professor = the experience = the grade = the preparedness = the reflection of the dept in the students it foster. The fact that INLS of all things has a rather interesting curriculum has made me consider a minor in it (def wanna take 523 if at all possible), but from coming in as a Freshman a few years back and hearing how our CS dept was really on the rise to now seeing these events happening and the uncertainty it brings -- can't help but feel empathy for the struggles of prospective CS majors.",2021-05-26 22:34:20,19
comment,Public records show process of CS major admissions fumble,"Yeah with other schools poaching the faculty here and the unbearable teaching load, no wonder the faculty all escape to other departments. Maybe I am not giving Majikes enough credit, but somehow I am not exactly confident of having Majikes's MyPoll tool being generalized to other courses. Btw I am *very* concerned that 524/550 is now handed to Majikes (or at least his tool) -- so vile. >From: David Plaisted > >Sent: 4/6/20216:09:21 PM > >To: Kevin Jeffay > >Subject: Re: \[faculty\] Re: Important message regarding upcoming changes to Computer Science majors. > >an order from the top Classic Plaisted.",2021-05-27 03:55:36,13
comment,Public records show process of CS major admissions fumble,"As someone who graduated in recent years, this is disheartening. I knew the nail in the coffin was when they had Majikes start teaching Algorithms (I’ve heard he’s now the sole instructor for Algorithms — perhaps the most important CS class, and one that he is woefully unqualified to teach), but I had been holding out hope that CS would get its own school and funding before I left. Looks like that’s clearly not the case. I get it, all the incoming students don’t want to lose their spot in the program. But an admissions based process NEEDS to happen going forward. The amount of cheating, laziness, and unrealistic entitlement towards grade inflation I saw as a TA was mindboggling. There is no way that top tech companies will continue to recruit if this is what the majority of our talent pool becomes (worsened by the fact that they now don’t even have the faculty or classes to train them). Heck, just the difference in the frequency of campus visits from places like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. from my freshman year at the school to my senior year was massive. Not to mention that most Unicorns already don’t touch us with a 10 ft pole. Unless UNC starts weeding people out and having realistic, challenging intro courses like 411 instead of the BS it’s now morphed into, there is no way this place keeps what’s left of its reputation. Hope Dr. Jeffay is able to pull this off, him and a handful of other profs have been carrying this department on their backs for years.",2021-05-26 21:45:56,17

comment,Public records show process of CS major admissions fumble,"Okay so to catch you up, in April they announced and then cancelled a plan to require applications for the CS major. So that’s not something you need to worry about. However, the fact remains that there are way too few faculty members for the number of students we have been having in the major in past years. So while they won’t require an application, they are still significant downsizing the major. If I remember the numbers correctly (there’s a previous post where I copied the email they sent out about this) there will only be 150 seats per semester in COMP 210. If you don’t already know, the basic sequence for a CS major by semester is: COMP 110 -> COMP 210+283 -> COMP 211+301 -> COMP 311 -> 2 electives per sem after that. There will still be plenty of seats in 110, since that course is a service to the general university. But 210, the first course for majors only, will have an artificially low seat cap so that the major as a whole shrinks in size. In other words the problem isn’t that no one can teach 210, but that as a whole there aren’t enough faculty to go around. Since that’s the first majors only course that’s where the “gate” is to the major.",2021-05-26 20:33:51,17

comment,Public records show process of CS major admissions fumble,"I know my opinion as a stranger on the internet doesn’t mean much but don’t stress over it. Having a passion for the material already places you over a very large percentage of students in the department. You’d be surprised at how many people flat out don’t attend classes, cheat on homework/projects, and don’t study for tests. Joining a CS club, making use of office hours and study groups, and *understanding* lecture material instead of trying to memorize things at the last minute will (IMO) place you well above your peers. A funny anecdote: 411 taught by Bishop was considered to be one of the hardest “weed out” classes before they got rid of it. The reality was that TWENTY FIVE percent of people got an A in the class. A distribution where that many people get As is pretty incredible for any class. Most of my freshman year gen eds didn’t hand out that many As. His tests were given on an online platform that would let you know if your answer was right or not as you were taking it (basically, 0 excuse not to do good if you studied and *understood* the assigned reading/material instead of trying to memorize slides) and let you adjust answers. I know, that sounds too good to be true right? IIRC, the grade distribution ended up being bimodal with an almost equal 25% of students getting a C or lower. Coincidentally that was similar to the proportion of filled seats that were empty after the first week of class. NONE of the several study groups I was part of for that class had anyone receive below a B-. And we were all far from being the “top students”, so it’s not like I was studying with geniuses. Different people might take away different things from that, but I’ve always thought back to it as an example of how many CS students think they can do the absolute bare minimum to get by and land the high paying jobs you hear about. Yet they’re the first in line to complain to the department and review bomb on RMP when they have to retake the class. Basically a very vocal minority. If an application process were to be put in place, I’d hope that those would be the exact people that are weeded out. Sorry for the rant, but what I meant to get at when writing this was that even in the rare event that the department is forced to have an admissions process for current students due to lack of funding, I think you’ll be fine as long as you keep that passion :)",2021-05-26 23:17:34,2

You suffocate to death. Drown in your own fluid in your lungs. Terrified, and there’s nothing your nurses can do. They’ll give you as much oxygen as they can and they’ll pray for you and they’ll still watch you die. And then they’ll go home and they’ll cry and watch people refuse to wear masks and go back in the next day and do it all over again. And students probably won’t die of it, but more people will as a direct result of students’ actions. I turned in my two weeks’ notice, because I can’t work and have a full time course load, but also because I’m done. I can’t do this anymore. I think care is going to start being rationed soon.

post,I can’t get myself to do anything.,"I can’t get myself to do anything. I know everyone else is struggling with this but I am so tired all the time. I wasn’t like this before, I struggled a lot with mental health but I had good outlets - sports, friends, events, just being out with people. I have not been out properly since everything went south during spring break. I’ve been sitting in the dark corner of my room everyday. I’ve tried to stay sane through indoor workouts but now I struggle to even get out of bed. I cry myself to sleep because I don’t know what to look forward to anymore. Online classes are actually ass. I don’t learn anything, everything feels so difficult. I see my friends be completely fine so I feel stupid talking about this to them but at the same time they’re still on campus or still go out and have fun and see their significant others or whatever but I literally have not seen anyone other than my toxic family for half a year now. The only thing actually keeping me not losing my fucking mind is going back to campus next semester but seeing the fucking selfish, absolutely moronic pieces of asses going out and partying to ruin it for those who have been doing everything right and barely fucking holding on by the thread to get back to the life we took for granted. I’ve tried hobbies, I’ve tried keeping myself busy, but I just don’t see the point anymore. I also lost both my jobs and I’ve been in therapy but soon I won’t be able to afford it anymore and I’m running out of money. I have a lot of pressure on me needing to be successful so I’ve always been one to do much more than just classes but now even doing the bare minimum for class is fucking difficult. And I can’t take a gap semester because it’ll mess with my financial aid nor do I want to delay my graduation any further because my personal circumstances REALLY favors on time graduation. I’m tired all the time, I feel sick all the time, everything aches (I don’t have covid), and I’m just so anxious and depressed. Classes are moving fast, everything is moving on too fast regardless of if we’re stuck in a ditch struggling to even open our eyes and I am just so fucking mad that I have changed. I used to be so ambitious. Now I just want to stop crying. I personally went through so much during high school. I was so excited to finally live my life. I worked so hard on myself (mental health wise) after many hospitalizations and I was so fucking excited but now I’m back to where I was, except now it’s out of my control.

comment,I can’t get myself to do anything.,"Reading this post, my heart is breaking for you; I have a lot of mental health issues that predated this pandemic also, and sometimes it really feels like there’s no adequate way to describe how impossible everything feels right now. You can only hear the phrase “unprecedented circumstances” so many times before you just want to scream. And I know that for me, the fact that nearly everyone is struggling lately makes me less inclined to want to reach out, because I feel like I would only be adding onto someone else’s emotional burden. But in spite of that, there’s a community here and we all can understand how hard it has been to be a student during this quarantine. Sometimes just the fact of feeling seen by other people can help lift a bit of the anxiety and depression. One of the resources at UNC that has been saving my life this semester (my first semester at UNC, if it matters) is using the academic coaching sessions through the learning center. Having that time once or twice a week to talk to someone “professional” about my classes and getting that extra help/support has seriously been the one thing keeping me (mostly) sane over the last few weeks. I don’t know if it helps or just sounds stupid coming from a stranger on Reddit, but everything you’re feeling is 100% valid and you don’t need to feel guilty or like something is wrong with you for not being able to function “normally” right now. I’m not sure what to say that won’t sound like a shitty, generic motivational quote. I’ve felt similarly brain-dead and non-functional lately from depression and isolation and the disappointment/anger/grief over how utterly inadequate our college experience at UNC is currently. So from one struggling UNC student to another, here’s a virtual (and therefore appropriately socially distanced) hug. Keep going, one day/hour/minute/second at a time. Take care of yourself and be kind to yourself in whatever ways you need to. You can do this. 🖤",2020-08-28 16:14:17,13

I'm sorry I don't know more; I'm not a student (UNC employee) but working with my therapist has been one of the more useful wkly rituals for me. I also wonder if you have the ability to take short walks outside? Some nature time + sunlight has improved my mental state on even the worse days.

comment,I can’t get myself to do anything.,"I’m just here to say I understand what it’s like to navigate Carolina while juggling mental health issues and having come from a chaotic and unhealthy background. What I don’t have experience with is doing that during a pandemic, because I graduated in 2006. It looks like your history has made you into a resilient person. (I have to remind myself from time to time that I survived all sorts of unmentionable traumas.) It’s the resiliency you had that got you through before that you need to tap into now. It’s there within you. If the depressive tendencies are getting you down, fight back with one action. Anything. Give depression the bird in the mirror. Whatever. Reach out to one friend. Don’t let it isolate you. You know what it’s like to climb. I believe people who have suffered the most have the potential to make the best leaders. But we have to work hard to turn our lives into success stories. Sometimes the success isn’t perfect grades or spinning fifty plates at the same time. Sometimes success is just showing up for yourself and hanging on when the going gets tough. Yes—it’s out of our control. We never had control of anything other than ourselves to begin with. Where do you stop, and where does the rest of the world begin? It’s your life. You’re not alone. It’s good you told the truth about how you’re feeling. I hope this day can help to be part of a turning point, or at the very least a confirmation that you’re still in the game.",2020-08-28 14:05:37,7

comment,I can’t get myself to do anything.,"Your feelings, your pain, and your frustrations are all valid and so human. I'm 32, have struggled with chronic major depression my whole life, and this year has been by far one of the most challenging years I've ever experienced. I'm sure most could agree. We are in an extended moment of collective trauma. Grief pervades everything. Just living is taking so much more effort and work. We have to keep pushing because it's our only option, but it's ok to acknowledge the absurdity and difficulty of ""performing normalcy"" when chaos is everywhere and the world is being torn apart at the seams. Don't feel alone. Don't feel the need to hold yourself to the same measures of success right now. We need to lighten our burdens wherever we can without sacrificing our goals and dreams and futures (if that's even possible at this point). People who are just transitioning from high school to college need to know that no one could ever ask or expect them to carry all this. The high school to college transition is so difficult under normal circumstances, and it's just insane that students are navigating that as well as a pandemic and societal upheaval on a scale I've never experienced before. This is new ground for everyone. It's ok to feel fucked up. I'd think something was wrong with you if you didn't feel fucked up. But don't give up. Keep pushing and please make sure to ask for help if everything gets too heavy to carry by yourself. We'll get through this.",2020-08-28 23:48:59,6

My only consolation is that in the future, there WILL be things to look forward to again. Life has peaks and troughs, and there are so many people at low points right now.

There is a very large old pasture park down past Merritt's store that is nearby and beautiful, or the area behind the forest theater. I would also form an intentional social group with rules, a pod.

comment,I can’t get myself to do anything.,"That’s key to staying sane, so good for you for getting out. I won’t bore you with the details, but when I graduated a few years ago I hit my lowest point. Like you, I thrive on social interaction to assist with mental health issues. I went from having hundreds of friends within walking distance to living at home away from all of them. I got to the point I didn’t want to get out of bed because I didn’t see the point. The best thing you can do is talk with people and don’t lay down all day like I did. Talk on the phone, keep meeting in person, heck, even write a letter to someone in a retirement home. Just stay engaged when you can but be okay with alone time. I used to get even more depressed when I’d think about all the cool stuff my friends were doing. I thought I was wasting my life. Now I’ve reached a point where I want to do things that, a year from now, will make me proud. Just always working to get better at something. Something as simple as doing a few pushups or making my bed. Know that even as bad as things look, this too shall pass. Focus on what you can control and keep on keepin on. Best of luck to you.

Your immaturity is glaringly obvious because you assumed to know my life just as you assumed to know OP’s life. I’m 32. I didn’t go to college when I was 18. I pulled myself through homelessness and built my life by working shit jobs for the last 14 years while seeing so many of my friends and coworkers fall into despair and lose their lives to addiction and suicide because, yeah, our lives were and still are fucking hard. I saved enough to put myself through community college but I could only afford a few classes at a time so it took me 4 years to get a 2 year degree and my grades got me a full scholarship to UNC. So I know firsthand how hard life can be, but I’ve also learned how important humility and respect are and I’ve learned that you can never know what someone else’s life is like.

post,Dog tried to attack me at Battle Park,"Dog tried to attack me at Battle Park I was out hiking today at Battle Park and came across a middle aged couple with a large black pit bull. As soon as the dog saw me, it charged at me trying to attack me. It wasn’t on a leash and they were letting it run around the hiking trails aimlessly. When I told them to get their dog as it ran up trying to maul me, they were able to coax it away from me. They offered to hold the dog while I walked past them on the trail but I told them it was fine and left. Then the husband yelled at me and said “well you’re going to see a lot of dogs out here!” instead of apologizing that their dog tried to maul me. He acted like I was the one in the wrong for going hiking and not being comfortable with someone else’s dog just charging at me out of nowhere. I’ve been a hiker for years and the people who have had theirs off a leash had them trained not to charge at people and were at least watchful of their dog.

But you definitely shouldn't react aggressively if a dog runs at you, just go with it, well fed dogs that are running towards you in a public area (where they wouldn't feel territorial) probably won't be violent.

Letting a dog run around like that in a public park is irresponsible, but if the only evidence this person has of “being mauled,” is the dog running up to them, then it’s highly unlikely they were actually attacked.

comment,Did they seriously just put mental health crisis counseling on the RAs?,"This is honestly not surprising. A similar thing happened when I was an RA at my undergrad, and the university response was to put it largely on our shoulders. I think the biggest issue with this was that they didn’t provide any additional mental health support for the RAs or any compensation for the added responsibilities and training. Worst of all, weren’t clear enough with how they communicated these new responsibilities to RAs. To us it sounded very much like “it is in your hands to make sure nobody else dies” and as you can guess, that had a terrible impact on our mental health.",2021-10-12 23:45:13,5

post,Things nobody tells you about UNC Registration,"Things nobody tells you about UNC Registration These are just random things I wish somebody told me about UNC registration/classes in general from a rising sophomore STEM double major. 1. The UNC registration system is just bad. CC is slow, has a lot of issues with glitches/crashing, and just isn’t intuitive. Do your best to work out how you can use it to your advantage before your registration time. 2. USE COURSICLE. I REPEAT. USE COURSICLE. 3. Always triple check that you checked the “waitlist if full” box for your ideal classes 4. Make like 3 potential schedules with different gen Ed/alternate classes on them. Trust me. The good/popular gen eds will fill up fast. 5. The pre-professional major declaration system is a mess. If you come in with more than 30 credit hours as a pre-prof major (Gillings, Hussman, Nursing, etc.) expect to struggle getting into some of your Sophomore year prerequisites (looking at you, BIOL 252). Your major will disappear from the system after you have 60 hours total and it might make your life seem awful. Trust me, people have this problem every single year. Just harass the right people enough and you should be able to fix it at some point. In the worst cases, you can probably take it over summer. 6. DO NOT DECLARE A NEW MAJOR (ESPECIALLY STEM) WITHIN A WEEK BEFORE REGISTRATION UNLESS YOU HAVE TO DO SO IN ORDER TO GET THE CLASSES YOU NEED. It will most likely put a hold on your account and you will have to call people crying until they remove the hold for you. And when you declare the major, advising will fail to tell you that those holds exist at all. 7. UNC’s entire registration system is designed to keep you there for 3-4 years, regardless of how many credits you come in with (unless you enter as a transfer from dual enrollment/early college). Don’t feel discouraged if it seems like you can’t get into your higher level classes as a freshman, because the system is designed to keep you from doing that. 8. The professors can make or break a lot of the harder intro classes, especially in STEM (heya chem 102). If you can, try to take the best professor available in those hard intro classes because it will make a world of difference. 9. You don’t have to do a double major or double minor or major+minor combo if you don’t want to. Declaring too many programs is not worth sacrificing your mental health, especially if you don’t enjoy those programs in the first place. 10. THE 2 STEM CLASS GUIDELINE EXISTS FOR A REASON. DO NOT TRY TO OVERLOAD STEM CLASSES FRESHMAN YEAR, YOU WILL HAVE NO LIFE. ESPECIALLY IF YOU DONT PARTICULARLY ENJOY STEM good luck for registration to everyone, especially all the new Tar Heels in here! And to any upperclassmen, feel free to drop more advice for registration below!",2021-06-09 18:54:34,133

comment,Things nobody tells you about UNC Registration,I think point no. 7 is a little bit cynical--the primary purpose of prioritizing registration based on class/credit hours is to make sure that people *get out* in 3-4 years.

comment,Things nobody tells you about UNC Registration,"There are 3 main websites people use when registering for/taking classes at UNC: Connect Carolina- where you will find your Tar Heel tracker (requirements you need to graduate), transcript, bills, holds, and where you actually do registration through the shopping cart in your student center. Coursicle- is basically a course planner but is really helpful to use because it’s visual. If you open CC and click on student center it will be in the academics menu on the left. People love it because it makes it easy to see how your classes are laid out throughout the week as well as consider all the possible recitations/sections of a class. Also nice because you can build multiple schedules at the same time in case classes fill up. Sakai- where professors will actually post their class pages with grades, resources, assignments,etc. usually Sakai sites (pages for each class) don’t pop up until a few days before classes start or the first day of class!",2021-06-09 19:38:19,10
comment,Things nobody tells you about UNC Registration,"That is fair! I just personally think it would make more sense to do registration based on credit hours rather than semesters in residence, since a lot of people who bring in credits have a difficult time getting their higher level classes as freshman/sophomore and end up picking up an extra major/minor to fill their schedule. I know I’ve personally picked up a second major and minor because otherwise I would be part time but still take 4 years to graduate from my primary major due to restrictions and the sequence of classes.",2021-06-10 11:59:08,8

comment,"21 face federal charges in bust of 'astonishing' drug distribution ring at UNC, Duke, App State :: WRAL.com","I wonder where the tipping point is where keeping the frats and sports around stops being worthwhile: sure, they both bring in money, but both are spawning scandals (frat scandals more frequent but sports scandals bigger) that do serious damage to the reputation of the school. I wonder if someone ever did try to quantify the reputational damage what the balance would look like. I mean, are you going to donate to UNC once you’re done with it? So they can piss your money away supporting sports and frats while continuing to starve the actual academics? A lot of people won’t, which Spurs the school to further lean on supporting the frats and sports in a vicious downward spiral. Meanwhile the frustrated faculty (sometimes) take their frustrations out on innocent students (cough cough chem department)... I mean, something really needs to change.",2020-12-17 13:27:16,15

comment,"21 face federal charges in bust of 'astonishing' drug distribution ring at UNC, Duke, App State :: WRAL.com","Idk why you're being downvoted. I think it's valid. Frat daddies come from money and may be legacies; they're giving a lot of money to the school and will probably donate after they graduate since they can afford to. But, I also think that they get way too much of a free pass to do whatever the fuck they want. Unfortunately, when they're the kids of donors or will be future donors themselves, it's hard to punish them too harshly because UNC would undoubtedly lose financial support. Perhaps one way to offset a small frat population would be to accept more out-of-state students since they have to pay a lot of money to attend? Edit: I should add that it looks like all the people involved are former students, so it's hard for UNC to police people who aren't a part of the university anymore.",2020-12-17 15:56:06,16

I'm just so disappointed at how loose the CarolinaTogether plan and standards are (in form and in execution). On top of that I feel like it is important we talk about how the BoG never gets the heat. It is always the chancellor who bears the burden. While I feel like KG should have spoken more, his vote/voice was clearly not the one who was the deciding factor. I wasn't here when the Silent Sam and Carol Folt situation was going down, but it seems like it was a similar thing. There is the worst style of management, it seems like the admin clash so much with the BoG, but have to be the ones who have to defend these decisions.

We hoist you over our shoulders, paying our tuition, our non-refundable housing fees, but we are pallbearers of your every decree.
